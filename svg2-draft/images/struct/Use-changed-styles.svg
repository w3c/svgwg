  <title>Style inheritance and the use element</title>
  <desc>
    Two circles, one of which is a re-styled clone of the other.
    This file demonstrates one of the cases where 
    the shadow-DOM style matching rules in SVG 2
    have a different effect than the SVG 1.1 style cloning rules. 
    The original circle on the left
    should have blue fill 
    and green stroke.
    In a conforming SVG 1.1 user agent,
    the re-used circle on the right
    should have orange fill and green stroke.
    In a conforming SVG 2 user agent,
    the re-used circle should have orange fill and purple stroke.
    In all cases,
    the stroke should be partially transparent
    and 20 units wide, 
    relative to a total circle diameter of 100 units.
