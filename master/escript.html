<h1>ECMAScript Language Binding</h1>

<p class="normativity"><strong>This appendix is normative.</strong></p>

<p>This appendix describes how to expose the SVG DOM to an ECMAScript language
environment [<a href="refs.html#ref-ECMA-262">ECMA-262</a>].</p>

<p>For descriptions of how interfaces and exceptions defined in other
specifications are to be exposed to an ECMAScript language environment,
consult the relevant specification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For DOM Level 2 Core interfaces and exceptions, see
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/ecma-script-binding.html">the DOM Level 2 Core ECMAScript Language Binding appendix</a>
  ([<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM2">DOM2</a>], appendix E).</li>
  <li>For DOM Level 2 Events interfaces, see

  ([<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM2VIEWS">DOM2VIEWS</a>], appendix C).</li>
  <li>For DOM Level 2 Style interfaces, see
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Style-20001113/ecma-script-binding.html">the DOM Level 2 Style ECMAScript Language Binding appendix</a>
  ([<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM2STYLE">DOM2STYLE</a>], appendix C).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h2>

<p>The SVG DOM defines a single exception, <a>SVGException</a>, which is
exposed to an ECMAScript language environment as follows.</p>

<p>The ECMAScript global object has a property named <code>"SVGException"</code>
whose value is an object with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A read only property named <code>"SVG_WRONG_TYPE_ERR"</code>, whose value is the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span> value 1.</li>
  <li>A read only property named <code>"SVG_INVALID_VALUE_ERR"</code>, whose value is the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span> value 2.</li>
  <li>A read only property named <code>"SVG_MATRIX_NOT_INVERTABLE"</code>, whose value is the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span> value 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>A host object that is an <a>SVGException</a> also has these three
properties on itself, or somewhere in its prototype chain.  Every such host
object also has a read only property named <code>"code"</code> whose value is a
<span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span>, corresponding to the
<a>SVGException::code</a> exception member on <a>SVGException</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Constants">Constants</h2>

<p>For every interface defined in the SVG DOM that has one or more constants
defined on it, there exists a property on the ECMAScript global object whose
name is the name of the interface, and whose value is an object with a read
only property for each of the constants.  The name of each of these read only
properties is the name of the corresponding constant, and the value is
a <span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span> with the same value as that of
the constant.</p>

<p>A host object that implements an interface with constants defined on it
has, on itself or somewhere in its prototype chain, these properties that
correspond to the constants.</p>

<h2 id="Types">Types</h2>

<p>The following table gives the corresponding ECMAScript type for the IDL
primitive types used in the SVG DOM.</p>

<table class='vert' summary='Map of IDL types to ECMAScript types'>
  <tr>
    <th>IDL type</th>
    <th>ECMAScript type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td><span class='dom-attr-type'>Boolean</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>float</td>
    <td><span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>long</td>
    <td><span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unsigned short</td>
    <td><span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unsigned long</td>
    <td><span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DOMString</td>
    <td><span class='dom-attr-type'>String</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>When an ECMAScript <span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span> is assigned to
a property that corresponds to an attribute of an IDL integer type (long,
unsigned short or unsigned long), or it is passed as an argument passed to an
operation for which the argument type is an IDL integer type, then behavior is
undefined if the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Number</span> value is not an
integer within the range of that type.</p>

<p>For an interface type, a host object that implements the given interface is
used.</p>

<h2 id="Objects">Objects</h2>

<p>A host object that implements a given interface has properties on itself,
or in its prototype chain, that correspond to the operations and attributes
defined on that interface and all its superinterfaces.</p>

<p>A property that corresponds to an attribute is read only if the attribute
is read only, and has a name that is the same as the name of the attribute.
When getting the property, a value of a type according to the <a href="#Types">Types</a>
section above is returned.  When setting the property, if it is not read only,
then behavior is defined only if a value of a type according to the
<a href="#Types">Types</a> section is assigned to it.</p>

<p>For example, if <var>a</var> is a host object that implements the
<a>SVGLength</a> interface, then evaluating the statement:</p>

<pre>a.valueAsString = "10";</pre>

<p>has defined behavior, but evaluating the statement:</p>

<pre>a.valueAsString = 10;</pre>

<p>does not.</p>

<p>A property that corresponds to an operation has a name that is the same
as the name of the operation, and has a value that is a
<span class='dom-attr-type'>Function</span> object.  The value returned
from the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Function</span> is of a type according
to the table in the <a href="#Types">Types</a> section above.  When calling
the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Function</span>, behavior is only defined
if the correct number of arguments is passed, and the type of each argument
is the type according to the <a href="#Types">Types</a> table.  Also,
behavior is only defined for invoking the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Function</span>
with a <span class='dom-attr-type'>this</span> value that is equal to
the object from which the <span class='dom-attr-type'>Function</span>
was obtained.</p>

<p>For example, if <var>L1</var> and <var>L2</var> are two distinct host objects that
implement the <a>SVGPointList</a> interface and <var>p</var> is a host object
that implements the <a>SVGPoint</a> interface, then evaluating the following
statement has defined behavior:</p>

<pre>L1.insertItemBefore(p, 0);</pre>

<p>Evaluating any of the following statements, however, does not:</p>

<pre>L1.insertItemBefore(p, '0');
L1.insertItemBefore(p, -1);
L1.insertItemBefore(p, 0.5);
L1.insertItemBefore(p);
L1.insertItemBefore(p, 0, 0);
L1.insertItemBefore({ x: 10, y: 20 }, 0);
L1.insertItemBefore.call([], p, 0);
L1.insertItemBefore.call(L2, p, 0);</pre>
