  <h2>Removed: Feature Strings</h2>
  <p>This appendix is no longer part of the SVG specification.
  <p>
    No new feature strings are added in SVG 2,
    as the <span class="attr-name">requiredFeatures</span> attribute has been dropped.
    Authors wishing to use feature testing to exclude older SVG viewers
    should use the strings as defined in SVG 1.1.
  
  <p>
    You can view <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature.html">the appendix in SVG 1.1</a>,
    or <a href="./">go back to the main page for SVG 2</a>.
