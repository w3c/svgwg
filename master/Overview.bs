Abstract: This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Version 2. SVG is a language based on XML for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics. SVG content is stylable, scalable to different display resolutions, and can be viewed stand-alone, mixed with HTML content, or embedded using XML namespaces within other XML languages. SVG also supports dynamic changes; script can be used to create interactive documents, and animations can be performed using declarative animation features or by using script.

<h2 id="Acknowledgments">
Acknowledgments</h2>

    The SVG Working Group would like to thank the following people 
    for contributing to this specification with patches or by 
    participating in discussions that resulted in changes to the 
    document: David Dailey, Eric Eastwood, Jarek Foksa, 
    Daniel Holbert, Paul LeBeau, Robert Longson, Henri Manson, 
    Ms2ger, Kari Pihkala, Philip Rogers, David Zbarsky.

    In addition, the SVG Working Group would like to acknowledge 
    the contributions of the editors and authors of the previous 
    versions of SVG – as much of the text in this document derives 
    from these earlier specifications – including:

    * Patrick Dengler, Microsoft Corporation (Version 1.1 Second Edition)
    * Jon Ferraiolo, ex Adobe Systems (Versions 1.0 and 1.1 First Edition; until 10 May 2006)
    * Anthony Grasso, ex Canon Inc. (Version 1.1 Second Edition)
    * Dean Jackson, ex W3C (Version 1.1 First Edition; until February 2007)
    * 藤沢 淳 (FUJISAWA Jun), Canon Inc. (Version 1.1 First Edition)

    Finally, the SVG Working Group would like to acknowledge the 
    great many people outside of the SVG Working Group who help 
    with the process of developing the SVG specifications. These 
    people are too numerous to list individually. They include but 
    are not limited to the early implementers of the SVG 1.0 and 1.1 
    languages (including viewers, authoring tools, and server-side 
    transcoders), developers of SVG content, people who have 
    contributed on the www-svg@w3.org and 
    svg-developers@yahoogroups.com email lists, other Working Groups 
    at the W3C, and the W3C Team. SVG 1.1 is truly a cooperative 
    effort between the SVG Working Group, the rest of the W3C, and 
    the public and benefits greatly from the pioneering work of early 
    implementers and content developers, feedback from the public, 
    and help from the W3C team.
