<h1>Scripting and Interactivity</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>SVG content can be interactive (i.e., responsive to
user-initiated events) by utilizing the following features in
the SVG language:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User-initiated actions such as button presses on the
  pointing device (e.g., a mouse) can cause <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/">animations</a>
  or <a href="interact.html">scripts</a> to execute.</li>

  <li>The user can initiate hyperlinks to new Web pages (see
  <a href="linking.html#Links">Links out of SVG content: the
  <span class="element-name">'a'</span> element</a>) by actions such
  as mouse clicks when the pointing device is positioned over
  particular graphics elements.</li>

  <li>In many cases, depending on the value of the <a>'zoomAndPan'</a>
  attribute on the <a>'svg'</a> element and on the
  characteristics of the user agent, users are able to zoom
  into and pan around SVG content.</li>

  <li>User movements of the pointing device can cause changes
  to the <a href="interact.html#Cursors">cursor</a> that shows
  the current position of the pointing device.</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter describes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about <a href="interact.html#SVGEvents">events</a>,
  including under which circumstances events are triggered</li>

  <li>how to indicate whether a given document can be
  <a href="interact.html#EnableZoomAndPanControls">zoomed and panned</a></li>

  <li>how to specify which <a href="interact.html#Cursors">cursors</a> to use</li>
</ul>

<p>Related information can be found in other chapters:</p>

<p>The following aspects of SVG are affected by events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using <a href="svgdom.html">SVG Document Object Model (DOM)</a>, a script can
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#widl-EventTarget-addEventListener">add or remove DOM 3 event listeners</a>
  ([<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS">DOM3EVENTS</a>], section 4.3 Interface Event Target) so that
  script can be invoked or ignored when a given event occurs on an event target</li>

  <li>SVG's <a>animation elements</a> can be defined to begin or end based on
  events.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">A number of events defined in SVG 1.1, <span class="event-name">SVGLoad</span>,
  <span class="event-name">SVGError</span> etc, have been replaced with the equivalent
unprefixed events defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#event-types-list">DOM 3 Events</a>
and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/fullindex.html#events-table">HTML</a>.
</p>

<p class="issue" data-issue="8">
There should be some more modern examples of using events in svg, e.g touch events (w reference to touch events spec).
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/">Device orientation</a> events might also be of interest.
</p>

<p>The following table lists the events defined by this specification, or that have
  further requirements or clarifications compared to the specification(s) where they are defined.
</p>

<p>The <em>Event name</em> in the
first column is the name to use within SVG's <a>animation elements</a> to
define the events which can start or end animations. The
<em>DOM3 Event name</em> in the second column is the name to use when
defining <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#widl-EventTarget-addEventListener">DOM 3 event listeners</a>
([<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS">DOM3EVENTS</a>], section 4.3).
</p>

<p>For events not listed in the table, such as events introduced in HTML or DOM 3 Events,
the respective <a>event type</a> is the name to use within SVG's <a>animation elements</a>.
</p>

<p>Requirements in the table on whether an event of a given type
bubbles or is cancelable apply only to events that are created and
dispatched by the user agent.  Events of those types created from script
using the <code>createEvent</code> method on the <a>Document</a> interface can be made to bubble
or be cancelable with the
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#widl-Event-initEvent'>initEvent</a>
method.</p>

<p>Details on the parameters passed to event listeners for the
event types for UI Events can be found in the ([<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS"> DOM3EVENTS</a>]) and ([<a href="refs.html#ref-UIEVENTS">UIEVENTS</a>]) specifications where the keybard event definition in UIEVENTS takes precedence over that in DOM3EVENTS.
For other event types, the parameters passed to event listeners
are described elsewhere in this specification.</p>

<p>Likewise, <a href='https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/#EventValueSyntax'>event-value timing specifiers</a>
used in <a>animation element</a> <a>'animate/begin'</a> and <a>'animate/end'</a>
attributes are resolved to concrete times only in response to "bubbling" and
"at target" phase events dispatched to the relevant element.</p>

<h2 id="UIEvents">User interface events</h2>

<p>On user agents which support interactivity, it is common for
authors to define SVG documents such that they are responsive
to user interface events. Among the set of possible user events
are <a href="interact.html#PointerEvents">pointer events</a>,
keyboard events, and document events.</p>

<p>In response to user interface (UI) events, the author might
start an animation, perform a hyperlink to another Web page,
highlight part of the document (e.g., change the color of the
graphics elements which are under the pointer), initiate a
"roll-over" (e.g., cause some previously hidden graphics
elements to appear near the pointer) or launch a script which
communicates with a remote database.</p>

<h2 id="PointerEvents">Pointer events</h2>

<p>User interface events that occur because of user actions
performed on a pointer device are called pointer events.</p>

<p>Many systems support pointer devices such as a mouse or
trackball. On systems which use a mouse, pointer events consist
of actions such as mouse movements and mouse clicks. On systems
with a different pointer device, the pointing device often
emulates the behavior of the mouse by providing a mechanism for
equivalent user actions, such as a button to press which is
equivalent to a mouse click.</p>

<p>For each pointer event, the SVG user agent determines the
<em>target element</em> of a given pointer event. The target
element is the topmost graphics element whose relevant
graphical content is under the pointer at the time of the
event. (See property <a>'pointer-events'</a> for a description
of how to determine whether an element's relevant graphical
content is under the pointer, and thus in which circumstances
that graphic element can be the target element for a pointer
event.) When an element is not displayed (i.e., when the
<a>'display'</a> property on that element
or one of its ancestors has a value of <span
class="prop-value">none</span>), that element cannot be the
target of pointer events.</p>

<p>If a target element for the pointer event exists, then
the event is dispatched to that element according to the
normal <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#event-flow'>event flow</a>
([<a href='refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS'>DOM3EVENTS</a>], section 1.2).
For shadow trees created by the <a>'use'</a> element or via script,
the event must follow the Shadow DOM
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-shadow-dom-20130514/#event-dispatch">event dispatching algorithm</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-SHADOWDOM">SHADOWDOM</a>]
</p>

<p>If a target element for the pointer event does not exist,
then the event is ignored.</p>

<h2 id="pointer-processing">Hit-testing and processing order for user interface events</h2>

<dl class='definitions'  data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">

  <dt id="TermHitTesting">hit-testing</dt>
  <dd>The process of determining whether a pointer intersects a given
  <a>graphics element</a>.  Hit-testing is used in determining which element
  to dispatch a mouse event to, which might be done in response to the user
  moving the pointing device, or by changes in the position, shape and
  other attributes of elements in the document.  Hit-testing is also known
  as <em>hit detection</em> or <em>picking</em>.  See also the definition of the
  <a>'pointer-events'</a> property.</dd>

</dl>

<p>There are two distinct aspects of pointer-device interaction with an element or area:</p>

<ol>
  <li>hit-testing, to determine if a pointer event (such as a mouse movement or mouse click) occurred within the interaction area of an element, and the subsequent DOM event flow;</li>
  <li>functional processing of actions associated with any relevant element.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hit-testing">Hit-testing</h3>

<p>Determining whether a pointer event results in a positive <a>hit-test</a>
depends upon the position of the pointer, the size and shape of the
<a>graphics element</a>, and the computed value of the <a>'pointer-events'</a>
property on the element.  The definition of the <a>'pointer-events'</a>
property below describes the exact region that is sensitive to pointer
events for a given type of graphics element.</p>

<p>Note that the <a>'svg'</a> element is not a <a>graphics element</a>, and in
a <a href="conform.html#ConformingSVGStandAloneFiles">Conforming SVG Stand-Alone File</a>
a <a>outermost svg element</a> will never be the target of pointer events,
though events can bubble to this element.
If a pointer event does not result in a positive <a>hit-test</a> on a
<a>graphics element</a>, then it should evoke any user-agent-specific window
behavior, such as a presenting a context menu or controls to allow zooming
and panning of an SVG document fragment.</p>

<p>This specification does not define the behavior of pointer events on the
<a>outermost svg element</a> for SVG images which are embedded by reference
or inclusion within another document, e.g., whether the <a>outermost svg element</a>
embedded in an HTML document intercepts mouse click events; future specifications
may define this behavior, but for the purpose of this specification, the behavior
is implementation-specific.</p>

<h3 id="event-processing">Event processing</h3>

<p>An element which is the target of a user interface event may have
particular interaction behaviors, depending upon the type of element and
whether it has explicit associated interactions, such as scripted event
listeners, CSS pseudo-classes matches, or declarative animations
with event-based timing.  The algorithm and order for processing
user interface events for a given target element, after dispatching the
DOM event, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If an event handler registered on this element invokes the <code>preventDefault()</code>
  DOM method, then no further processing for this element is performed, and the
  event follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#event-flow">event dispatch and DOM event flow processing</a>
  as described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/">DOM Level 3 Events</a>
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS">DOM3EVENTS</a>] (or its successor);</li>

  <li>If the element has an associated title or description, such as a <a>'title element'</a>
  element, and the user agent supports the display
  of such information (e.g. via a tooltip or status-bar message), that information
  should be displayed, as appropriate to the type of pointer event;</li>

  <li>If the element matches any relevant
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/selector.html#pseudo-class-selectors">dynamic pseudo-class selectors</a>
  appropriate to the type of pointer event, such as <code>:hover</code>,
  <code>:active</code>, or <code>:focus</code> as described in
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>], section 5.11, then the relevant class
  properties are applied;</li>

  <li>If the element and the event type are associated with the activation
  or cancelation of declarative animation though the use of
  <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/#EventValueSyntax">event-value</a> timing specifiers,
  any corresponding instance times must be resolved, and any conseqential
  actions of this instance time resolution (such as immediately starting
  or stopping the animation) must be performed;</li>

  <li>If the element is a hyperlink (e.g., it is a descendant element of an <a>'a'</a>
  element), and the pointer event is of a type that activates that hyperlink (e.g.
  via a mouse click), and if the hyperlink traversal changes the context of the
  content (e.g. opens a different document, or moves the pointer away from this
  element by moving to another part of the same document), then no further
  processing for this element is performed;</li>

  <li>If the element is a <a>text content element</a>, and the event type is one
  which the user agent recognizes as part of a text-selection operation (e.g.,
  a mouse click and drag, or a double-click), then the
  <a href="text.html#TextSelection">text selection</a> algorithm is performed;</li>

  <li>If the event type is one which the user agent associates with the evocation
  of special user-interface controls (e.g., a right-click or command-click
  evoking a context menu), the user agent should evoke such user-agent-specific
  behavior, such as presenting a context menu or controls to allow zooming and
  panning of an SVG document fragment.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="PointerEventsProp">The <span class="property">'pointer-events'</span> property</h2>

<p>In different circumstances, authors may want to control
under what conditions particular graphic elements can become
the target of pointer events. For example, the author might
want a given element to receive pointer events only when the
pointer is over the stroked perimeter of a given shape. In
other cases, the author might want a given element to ignore
pointer events under all circumstances so that graphical
elements underneath the given element will become the target of
pointer events.</p>

<p>The effects of masking and clipping differ with respect to
<a href="interact.html#PointerEventsProperty">pointer events</a>.  A clip path is
a geometric boundary, and a given point is clearly either inside or outside that
boundary; thus, pointer events must be captured normally over the rendered areas
of a clipped element, but must not be captured over the clipped areas, as described
in the definition of <a>clipping paths</a>.
By contrast, a mask is not a binary transition, but a pixel operation, and
different behavior for fully transparent and almost-but-not-fully-transparent may
be confusingly arbitrary; as a consequence, for elements with a mask applied,
pointer events must still be captured even in areas where the mask goes to zero
opacity.  If an author wishes to achieve an effect where the transparent parts
of a mask allow pointer events to pass to an element below, a combination of
masking and clipping may be used.</p>

<p>The <a>'filter property'</a> property has no effect on pointer events
processing, and must in this context be treated as if the <a>'filter property'</a>
wasn't specified.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a circle with a <a>'stroke'</a> of
<span class="prop-value">red</span> (i.e., the outline is solid red) and a
<a>'fill'</a> of <span class="prop-value">none</span> (i.e., the interior is not
painted) is rendered directly on top of a rectangle with a <a>'fill'</a> of
<span class="prop-value">blue</span>. The author might want the circle to be
the target of pointer events only when the pointer is over the perimeter of
the circle. When the pointer is over the interior of the circle, the author
might want the underlying rectangle to be the target element of pointer
events.</p>

<p>The <a>'pointer-events'</a> property specifies under what circumstances a
given element can be the target element for a pointer event. It affects
the circumstances under which the following are processed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user interface events such as mouse clicks</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/selector.html#pseudo-class-selectors">dynamic pseudo-classes</a>
  (i.e., :hover, :active and :focus; [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>],
  section 5.11)</li>

  <li>hyperlinks (see <a href="linking.html#Links">Links out of

  element</a>)</li>

<p>Magnification represents a complete, uniform
transformation on an SVG document fragment, where the magnify operation scales
all graphical elements by the same amount. A magnify operation
has the effect of a supplemental scale and translate
transformation placed at the outermost level on the SVG
document fragment (i.e., outside the <a>outermost svg element</a>).</p>

<p>Panning represents a translation (i.e., a shift)
transformation on an SVG document fragment in response to a
user interface action.</p>

<p>SVG user agents that operate in interaction-capable user
environments are required to support the ability to magnify and pan.</p>

<p>The <a>outermost svg element</a>

<h2 id="Cursors">Cursors</h2>

<p>Some interactive display environments provide the ability to
modify the appearance of the pointer, which is also known as
the <em>cursor</em>. Three types of cursors are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard built-in cursors</li>
  <li>Platform-specific custom cursors</li>
  <li>Platform-independent custom cursors</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a>'cursor property'</a> property is used to
specify which cursor to use. The <a>'cursor property'</a> property can be used to
reference standard built-in cursors by specifying a keyword
such as <em>crosshair</em> or a custom cursor. Custom cursors
are referenced via a <a>&lt;url&gt;</a> and can point to either an
external resource such as a platform-specific cursor file or to
a <a>'cursor element'</a> element, which can be
used to define a platform-independent cursor.</p>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">
<h3 id="CursorProperty">The effect of the <span class="property">'cursor'</span> property</h3>

<p class="note">See the CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3 specification
for the definition of <a>'cursor property'</a>. [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS3UI">CSS3UI</a>]</p>

<p>SVG uses the <a>'cursor property'</a> property to specify the type of cursor to
be displayed for the pointing device when it is over a region of an
element that is sensitive to pointer events, according to the value of
the <a>'pointer-events'</a> property.  SVG extends the definition of
<a>'cursor property'</a> from the CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3
specification as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SVG implementation must support an <a>&lt;url&gt;</a> value
  being a reference to an SVG <a>'cursor element'</a> element.
  If the &lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt; values are given for a <a>&lt;url&gt;</a>

  <a>'cursor/x'</a> and <a>'cursor/y'</a> attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="CursorElement">The <span class="element-name">'cursor'</span> element</h3>

<edit:with element='cursor'>

<p>The <a>'cursor element'</a> element can
be used to define a platform-independent custom cursor. A
recommended approach for defining a platform-independent custom
cursor is to create a PNG image [<a href="refs.html#ref-PNG">PNG</a>]
and define a <a>'cursor element'</a> element
that references the PNG image and identifies the exact position
within the image which is the pointer position (i.e., the hot spot).</p>

<p>The PNG format is recommended because it supports the
ability to define a transparency mask via an alpha channel. If
a different image format is used, this format should support
the definition of a transparency mask (two options: provide an
explicit alpha channel or use a particular pixel color to
indicate transparency). If the transparency mask can be
determined, the mask defines the shape of the cursor;
otherwise, the cursor is an opaque rectangle. Typically, the
other pixel information (e.g., the R, G and B channels) defines
the colors for those parts of the cursor which are not masked
out. Note that cursors usually contain at least two colors so
that the cursor can be visible over most backgrounds.</p>

<h2 id="Focus">Focus</h2>

<p>
    SVG uses the same <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#focus">focus model</a>
    as HTML, modified for SVG as described in this section.  
    At most one element in each document is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#focused">focused</a> at a time;
    if the document as a whole has system focus, 
    this element becomes the target of all keyboard events.
</p>
<p> When an element is focused, 
    the element matches the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#the-user-action-pseudo-classes-hover-act">CSS <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class</a>. 
    Interactive user agents must visually indicate focus (usually with an outline)
    when the focus changes because of a user input event 
    from the keyboard or other non-pointing device
    and may indicate focus at all times.
    Authors may use the <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class to 
    replace the visual indication with one more suitable to the graphic,
    (such as a stroke on a shape)
    but should not use it to remove visual indications of focus completely.
</p>
<p>
    The following SVG elements are <dfn id="TermFocusable">focusable</dfn>
    in an interactive document.
    Any <a>instance</a> of such an element in a <a>use-element shadow tree</a>
    is also focusable.
    For the purpose of the HTML focus model, 
    interactive user agents must treat them as
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#focusable">focusable areas</a> 
    whose <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#can-be-focused">tabindex focus flag</a> should be set:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the document root element</li>
    <li>an <a>'svg'</a> element which has <a href="ZoomAndPanAttribute">zoom and pan</a> controls</li>
    <li>any element (such as within a <a>'foreignObject'</a>) 
        that generates a scrollable region
    </li>
    <li><a>'iframe'</a> elements that are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#browsing-context-container"></a>browsing context containers</li>
    <li><a>'audio'</a> and <a>'video'</a> elements with user controls</li>
    <li>any directly <a>rendered element</a> 
        with a valid integer <a>'tabindex'</a> attribute</li>
</ul>
<p> In the case of user-agent supplied controls, 
    the element may have more than one focusable area,
    for each sub-control.
</p>
<p> In addition, all <a>'a'</a> elements that are valid links are <a>focusable</a>,
    and their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#can-be-focused">tabindex focus flag</a> must be set 
    <em>unless</em> the user agent normally provides an alternative method
    of keyboard traversal of links.
</p>
<p>
    For compatibility with content that used the 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/interact.html#focusable-attr">SVG Tiny 1.2 <span class="attr-name">focusable</span> attribute</a>,
    user agents should treat an element with a value of
    <span class="attr-value">true</span> for that attribute as focusable.
    In new content, authors should either omit the <span class="attr-name">focusable</span> attribute
    or use it only in combination with a corresponding 
    <span class="attr-name">tabindex</span> value of <span class="attr-value">0</span>.
</p>
<p>
    User agents may treat other elements as focusable,
    particularly if keyboard interaction is the only or primary means of user input.
    In particular, user agents may support using keyboard focus 
    to reveal <a>'title'</a> element text as tooltips,
    and may allow focus to reach elements which have been assigned 
    listeners for mouse, pointer, or focus events.
    Authors should not rely on this behavior;
    all interactive elements should directly support keyboard interaction.
</p>
<p>
    The sequential focus order is generated from the set of all <a>focusable</a> elements,
    processing <a>'tabindex'</a> attributes on SVG elements
    in the same way as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#the-tabindex-attribute">tabindex attributes on HTML elements</a>.
    Content within a <a>use-element shadow tree</a>
    is inserted in the focus order as if it was child content
    of the <a>'use'</a> element.
</p>
<div class='note'>
    A <a>non-rendered element</a> can never receive focus, 
    regardless of the value of the <a>'tabindex'</a> attribute,
    If a script programmatically assigns focus to a non-rendered 
    or otherwise un-focusable element, the focusing call is aborted.
    Note, however, that an element that is not visible or onscreen
    may still be <a>rendered</a>.
</div>
<p> When the user agent supports scrolling or panning of the SVG document,
    and focus moves to an element that is currently outside the SVG viewport,
    the user agent should scroll or pan the document
    until the focused element is within the SVG viewport.
</p>
    
<p> As in HTML, an SVG element that is <a>focusable</a>
    but does not have a defined
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#activation-behavior">activation behavior</a>
    has an activation behaviour that does nothing 
    (unless a script specifically responds to it).
</p>
<p class="note">
    This means that an element that is only focusable 
    because of its <a>'tabindex'</a> attribute 
    will fire a <code>click</code> event 
    in response to a non-mouse activation 
    (e.g. hitting the "enter" key while the element has <a>focus</a>).
</p>
    
<p>
    For documents that contain a mix of inline HTML and SVG, 
    focus is handled for the document as a whole 
    (with a combined sequential focus order), 
    not with each inline SVG or HTML fragment as an isolated subdocument.
</p>

<div class='note'>
  <p>For example, in the following document, pressing Tab would cycle the focus
  between elements A, B and C, in that order.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;button id="A" tabindex="1"&gt;First thing&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="C" tabindex="2"&gt;Third thing&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;svg width="200" height="200"&gt;
  &lt;text id="B" tabindex="1" x="100" y="100"&gt;Second thing&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>Note that SVG elements do not have an equivalent of HTML's
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a>
attribute.</p>
</div>

  <p>A <a>'script'</a> element is equivalent to the <a>'script'</a> element in
  HTML and thus is the place for scripts (e.g., ECMAScript). Any functions
  defined within any <a>'script'</a> element have a "global" scope across the
  entire current document.</p>
  
  <p>The script's text content is never directly rendered;
  the <a>'display'</a> value for the <a>'script element'</a> element
  must always be set to <span class="prop-value">none</span>
  by the <a>user agent style sheet</a>,
  and this declaration must have importance over any other CSS rule or presentation attribute.
  </p>

  <p id="ScriptElementExecution">Before attempting to execute the <a>'script'</a>
  element the resolved media type value for <a>'script/type'</a> must be inspected.
  If the <a>SVG user agent</a> does not support the scripting language then the
  <a>'script'</a> element must not be executed.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p id="ExampleScript01">This example defines a function
  <code>circle_click</code> which is called by the
  <a>'onclick'</a> event attribute on the <a>'circle'</a> element. The drawing

  the result after clicking on the circle.</p>
