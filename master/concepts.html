<h1>Concepts</h1>

    <h2 id="Intro">Explaining the name: SVG</h2>
    <p class="explain">SVG stands for <a
    href="#Scalable">S</a>calable <a href="#Vector">V</a>ector <a
    href="#Graphics">G</a>raphics, an <a href="#XML">XML</a>
    grammar for <a href="#Stylable">stylable</a> graphics, usable
    as an <a href="#Namespace">XML namespace</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="Scalable" edit:toc="no">Scalable</h3>
    <p>To be scalable means to increase or decrease uniformly. In
    terms of graphics, scalable means not being limited to a
    single, fixed, pixel size. On the Web, scalable means that a
    particular technology can grow to a large number of files, a
    large number of users, a wide variety of applications. SVG,
    being a graphics technology for the Web, is scalable in both
    senses of the word.</p>
    <p>SVG graphics are scalable to different display resolutions,
    so that for example printed output uses the full resolution of
    the printer and can be displayed at the same size on screens of
    different resolutions. The same SVG graphic can be placed at
    different sizes on the same Web page, and re-used at different
    sizes on different pages. SVG graphics can be magnified to see
    fine detail, or to aid those with low vision.</p>
    <p>SVG graphics are scalable because the same SVG content can
    be a stand-alone graphic or can be referenced or included
    inside other SVG graphics, thereby allowing a complex
    illustration to be built up in parts, perhaps by several
    people. The <a href="#Symbols">symbol</a>, marker and <a
    href="#Fonts">font</a> capabilities promote re-use of graphical
    components, maximize the advantages of HTTP caching and avoid
    the need for a centralized registry of approved symbols.</p>
    <h3 id="Vector" edit:toc="no">Vector</h3>
    <p>Vector graphics contain geometric objects such as lines and
    curves. This gives greater flexibility compared to raster-only
    formats (such as PNG and JPEG) which have to store information
    for every pixel of the graphic. Typically, vector formats can
    also integrate raster images and can combine them with vector
    information such as clipping paths to produce a complete
    illustration; SVG is no exception.</p>
    <p>Since all modern displays are raster-oriented, the
    difference between raster-only and vector graphics comes down
    to where they are rasterized; client side in the case of vector
    graphics, as opposed to already rasterized on the server. SVG
    gives control over the rasterization process, for example to
    allow anti-aliased artwork without the ugly aliasing typical of
    low quality vector implementations. SVG also provides
    client-side <a href="#RasterEffects">raster filter effects</a>,
    so that moving to a vector format does not mean the loss of
    popular effects such as soft drop shadows.</p>
    <h3 id="Graphics" edit:toc="no">Graphics</h3>
    <p>Most existing XML grammars represent either textual
    information, or represent raw data such as financial
    information. They typically provide only rudimentary graphical
    capabilities, often less capable than the HTML 'img' element.
    SVG fills a gap in the market by providing a rich, structured
    description of vector and mixed vector/raster graphics; it can
    be used stand-alone, or as an <a href="#Namespace">XML
    namespace</a> with other grammars.</p>
    <h3 id="XML" edit:toc="no">XML</h3>
    <p>XML, a for
    structured information exchange, has become extremely popular
    and is both widely and reliably implemented. By being written
    in XML, SVG builds on this strong foundation and gains many
    advantages such as a sound basis for internationalization,
    powerful structuring capability, an object model, and so on. By
    building on existing, cleanly-implemented specifications,
    XML-based grammars are open to implementation without a huge
    reverse engineering effort.</p>
    <h3 id="Namespace" edit:toc="no">Namespace</h3>
    <p>It is certainly useful to have a stand-alone, SVG-only
    viewer. But SVG is also intended to be used as one component in
    a multi-namespace XML application. This multiplies the power of
    each of the namespaces used, to allow innovative new content to
    be created. For example, SVG graphics may be included in a
    document which uses any text-oriented XML namespace - including
    XHTML. A scientific document, for example, might also use <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-MathML2-20010221/">MathML</a> for mathematics
    in the document. The combination of SVG and SMIL leads to
    interesting, time based, graphically rich presentations.</p>
    <p>SVG is a good, general-purpose component for any
    multi-namespace grammar that needs to use graphics.</p>
    <h3 id="Stylable" edit:toc="no">Stylable</h3>
    <p>The advantages of style sheets in terms of presentational
    control, flexibility, faster download and improved maintenance
    are now generally accepted, certainly for use with text. SVG
    extends this control to the realm of graphics.</p>
    <p>The combination of scripting, DOM and CSS is often termed
    "Dynamic HTML" and is widely used for animation, interactivity
    and presentational effects. SVG allows the same script-based
    manipulation of the document tree and the style sheet.</p>
    <h2 id="Concepts">Important SVG concepts</h2>
    <h3 id="GraphicalObjects" edit:toc="no">Graphical Objects</h3>
    <p>With any XML grammar, consideration has to be given to what
    exactly is being modelled. For textual formats, modelling is
    typically at the level of paragraphs and phrases, rather than
    individual nouns, adverbs, or phonemes. Similarly, SVG models
    graphics at the level of graphical objects rather than
    individual points.</p>
    <p>SVG provides a general path element, which can be used to
    create a huge variety of graphical objects, and also provides
    common <a href="intro.html#TermBasicShape">basic shapes</a>
    such as rectangles and ellipses. These are convenient for hand
    coding and may be used in the same ways as the more general
    path element. SVG provides fine control over the coordinate
    system in which graphical objects are defined and the
    transformations that will be applied during rendering.</p>
    <h3 id="Symbols" edit:toc="no">Symbols</h3>
    <p>It would have been possible to define some standard symbols
    that SVG would provide. But which ones? There would always be
    additional symbols for electronics, cartography, flowcharts,
    etc., that people would need that were not provided until the
    "next version". SVG allows users to create, re-use and share
    their own symbols without requiring a centralized registry.
    Communities of users can create and refine the symbols that
    they need, without having to ask a committee. Designers can be
    sure exactly of the graphical appearance of the symbols they
    use and not have to worry about unsupported symbols.</p>
    <p>Symbols may be used at different sizes and orientations, and
    can be restyled to fit in with the rest of the graphical
    composition.</p>
    <h3 id="RasterEffects" edit:toc="no">Raster Effects</h3>
    <p>Many existing Web graphics use the filtering operations
    found in paint packages to create blurs, shadows, lighting
    effects and so on. With the client-side rasterization used with
    vector formats, such effects might be thought impossible. SVG
    allows the declarative specification of filters, either singly
    or in combination, which can be applied on the client side when
    the SVG is rendered. These are specified in such a way that the
    graphics are still scalable and displayable at different
    resolutions.</p>
    <h3 id="Fonts" edit:toc="no">Fonts</h3>
    <p>Graphically rich material is often highly dependent on the
    particular font used and the exact spacing of the glyphs. In
    many cases, designers convert text to outlines to avoid any
    font substitution problems. This means that the original text
    is not present and thus searchability and accessibility suffer.
    In response to feedback from designers, SVG includes font
    elements so that both text and graphical appearance are
    preserved.</p>
    <h3 id="Animation" edit:toc="no">Animation</h3>
    <p>Animation can be produced via script-based manipulation of
    the document, but scripts are difficult to edit and interchange
    between authoring tools is harder. Again in response to
    feedback from the design community, SVG includes declarative
    animation elements which were designed collaboratively by the
    SVG and SYMM Working Groups. This allows the animated effects
    common in existing Web graphics to be expressed in SVG.</p>
    <h2 id="UsageOptions">Options for using SVG in Web pages</h2>
    <p>There are a variety of ways in which SVG content can be
    included within a Web page. Here are some of the options:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>A stand-alone SVG Web page</dt>
      <dd> In this case, an SVG document (i.e., a Web resource whose
      MIME type is "<tt>image/svg+xml</tt>") is loaded directly
      into a user agent such as a Web browser. The SVG document is
      the Web page that is presented to the user.</dd>
      <dt>Embedding by reference</dt>
      <dd>In this case, a parent Web page references a separately
        stored SVG document and specifies that the given SVG
        document should be embedded as a component of the parent
        Web page. For HTML or XHTML, here are three options: 
        <ul>
          <li>The HTML/XHTML <span
          class="element-name">'img'</span> element is the most
          common method for using graphics in HTML pages. For
          faster display, the width and height of the image can be
          given as attributes. One attribute that is required is
          <span class="attr-name">'alt'</span>, used to give an
          alternate textual string for people browsing with images
          off, or who cannot see the images. The string cannot
          contain any markup. A <span
          class="attr-name">'longdesc'</span> attribute lets you
          point to a longer description - often in HTML - which can
          have markup and richer formatting.</li>
          <li>The HTML/XHTML <span
          class="element-name">'object'</span> element can contain
          other elements nested within it, unlike <span
          class="element-name">'img'</span>, which is empty. This
          means that several different formats can be offered,
          using nested <span class="element-name">'object'</span>
          elements, with a final textual alternative (including
          markup, links, etc). The outermost element which can be
          displayed will be used.</li>
          <li>The HTML/XHTML <span
          class="element-name">'applet'</span> element which can
          invoke a Java applet to view SVG content within the given
          Web page. These applets can do many things, but a common
          task is to use them to display images, particularly ones
          in unusual formats or which need to be presented under
          the control of a program for some other reason.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Embedding inline</dt>
      <dd>In this case, SVG content is embedded inline directly within
      the parent Web page. An example is an XHTML Web page with an
      SVG document fragment textually included within the
      XHTML.</dd>
      <dt>External link, using the HTML <span
      class="element-name">'a'</span> element</dt>
      <dd>This allows any stand-alone SVG viewer to be used, which can
      (but need not) be a different program to that used to display
      HTML. This option typically is used for unusual image
      formats.</dd>
      <dt>Referenced from a CSS or XSL property</dt>
      <dd>When a user agent supports CSS-styled XML content [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>]
      or XSL [<a href="refs.html#ref-XSL">XSL</a>] and the user agent is a <a
      href="conform.html#ConformingSVGViewers">Conforming SVG
      Viewer</a>, then that user agent must support the ability to
      reference SVG resources wherever CSS or XSL properties allow
      for the referencing of raster images, including the ability
      to tile SVG graphics wherever necessary and the ability to
      composite the SVG into the background if it has transparent
      portions. Examples include the <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/colors.html#propdef-background-image">
      <span class="property">'background-image'</span></a> and <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/generate.html#propdef-list-style-image">
      <span class="property">'list-style-image'</span></a>
      properties ([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>], sections 14.2.1 and 12.6.2)
      that are included in both CSS and XSL.</dd>
