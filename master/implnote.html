<h1>Implementation Requirements</h1>

<p class="normativity"><strong>This appendix is normative.</strong></p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The following are notes about implementation requirements
corresponding to various features in the SVG language.</p>

<h2 id="ErrorProcessing">Error processing</h2>

<p>There are various scenarios where an SVG document fragment
is technically <em>in error</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the content does not conform to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0
  specification</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-XML10">XML10</a>], such as the
  use of incorrect XML syntax</li>

  <li>When an element in the SVG namespace is encountered which is not listed
  as being a valid child of its parent according to the parent element's
  definition</li>
  
  <li>When an attribute in no namespace is encountered on an SVG element,
  and the attribute is not listed as being a valid attribute for that element
  according to the element's definition</li>

  <li>When an element has an attribute or property value which
  is not permissible according to this specification</li>

  <li>Other situations that are described as being <em>in error</em> in this
  specification</li>
</ul>

<p>A document can go in and out of error over time. For
example, document changes from the <a href="svgdom.html">SVG DOM</a>
or from <a href="animate.html">animation</a> can cause
a document to become <em>in error</em> and a further change can
cause the document to become correct again.</p>

<p>The following error processing shall occur when a document
is in error:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The document shall be rendered up to, but not including,
    the first element which has an error. Exceptions: 
    <ul>
      <li>If a <a>'path'</a> element is the
      first element which has an error and the only errors are
      in the <a href="paths.html#PathData">path data</a>
      specification, then render the <a>'path'</a> up to the point of the
      path data error. For related information, see <a
      href="implnote.html#PathElementImplementationNotes"><span
      class="element-name">'path'</span> element implementation
      notes</a>.</li>

      <li>If a <a>'polyline'</a> or <a>'polygon'</a> element is the
      first element which has an error and the only errors are
      within the <a>'polyline/points'</a> attribute, then render
      the <a>'polyline'</a> or <a>'polygon'</a> up to the segment
      with the error.</li>
    </ul>
    This approach will provide a visual clue to the user or
    developer about where the error might be in the document.
  </li>

  <li>If the document has animations, the animations shall stop
  at the point at which an error is encountered and the visual
  presentation of the document shall reflect the animated
  status of the document at the point the error was
  encountered.</li>

  <li>A highly perceivable indication of error shall occur. For
  visual rendering situations, an example of an indication of
  error would be to render a translucent colored pattern such
  as a checkerboard on top of the area where the SVG content is
  rendered.</li>

  <li>If the user agent has access to an error reporting
  capability such as status bar, it is recommended that the
  user agent provide whatever additional detail it can to
  enable the user or developer to quickly find the source of
  the error. For example, the user agent might provide an error
  message along with a line number and character number at
  which the error was encountered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of situations where a block of scripting changes
might cause a given SVG document fragment to go into and out of
error, error processing shall occur only at times when document
presentation (e.g., rendering to the display device) is
updated. In particular, error processing shall be disabled
whenever redraw has been suspended via DOM calls to
<a>SVGSVGElement::suspendRedraw</a>.</p>

<h2 id="VersionControl">Version control</h2>

<p class='issue'>Here we previously required SVG user agents to
check the PUBLIC identifier in a DOCTYPE declaration or the
"version" of the SVG language as represented by the namespace
to verify that it understands the version of SVG the document
was authored against.  It also had wording about not needing
to render future specification's elements, and for a UA to
alert the user if it encounters a version it doesn't recognise.
This should all be replaced with some wording about how to
process elements the UA recognises and those that it doesn't,
without any reference to versions of the specification.</p>

<h2 id="RangeClamping">Clamping values which are restricted to a particular range</h2>

<p>Some numeric attribute and property values have restricted
ranges, such as color component values. When out-of-range
values are provided, the user agent shall defer any error
checking until after presentation time, as composited actions
might produce intermediate values which are out-of-range but
final values which are within range.</p>

<p>Color values are not in error if they are out-of-range, even
if final computations produce an out-of-range color value at
presentation time. It is recommended that user agents clamp
color values to the nearest color value (possibly determined by
simple clipping) which the system can process as late as
possible (e.g., presentation time), although it is acceptable
for user agents to clamp color values as early as parse time.
Thus, implementation dependencies might preclude consistent
behavior across different systems when out-of-range color
values are used.</p>

<p>Opacity values out-of-range are not in error and should be
clamped to the range 0 to 1 at the time which opacity values
have to be processed (e.g., at presentation time or when it is
necessary to perform intermediate filter effect
calculations).</p>

<h2 id="PathElementImplementationNotes"><span class="element-name">'path'</span> element implementation notes</h2>

<p class="issue">We should move all of this into the relevant chapters,
rather than having it hidden here in an appendix.</p>

<p>A conforming SVG user agent must implement path rendering as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Error handling: 
    <ul>
      <li>The general rule for error handling in path data is
      that the SVG user agent shall render a <a>'path'</a> element up
      to (but not including) the path command containing the
      first error in the path data specification. This will
      provide a visual clue to the user or developer about
      where the error might be in the path data specification.
      This rule will greatly discourage generation of invalid
      SVG path data.</li>

      <li>If a path data command contains an incorrect set of
      parameters, then the given path data command is rendered
      up to and including the last correctly defined path
      segment, even if that path segment is a sub-component of
      a compound path data command, such as a "lineto" with
      several pairs of coordinates. For example, for the path
      data string <span class='attr-value'>'M 10,10 L 20,20,30'</span>,
      there is an odd number of parameters for the "L" command, which requires an even
      number of parameters. The user agent is required to draw
      the line from (10,10) to (20,20) and then perform error
      reporting since <span class='attr-value'>'L 20 20'</span>
      is the last correctly defined segment of the path data specification.</li>

      <li>Wherever possible, all SVG user agents shall report
      all errors to the user.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Markers, directionality and zero-length path segments: 
    <ul>
      <li>If markers are specified, then a marker is drawn on
      every applicable vertex, even if the given vertex is the
      end point of a zero-length path segment and even if
      "moveto" commands follow each other.</li>

      <li>Certain line-capping and line-joining situations and
      markers require that a path segment have directionality
      at its start and end points. Zero-length path segments
      have no directionality. In these cases, the following
      algorithm is used to establish directionality: to
      determine the directionality of the start point of a
      zero-length path segment, go backwards in the path data
      specification within the current subpath until you find a
      segment which has directionality at its end point (e.g.,
      a path segment with non-zero length) and use its ending
      direction; otherwise, temporarily consider the start
      point to lack directionality. Similarly, to determine the
      directionality of the end point of a zero-length path
      segment, go forwards in the path data specification
      within the current subpath until you find a segment which
      has directionality at its start point (e.g., a path
      segment with non-zero length) and use its starting
      direction; otherwise, temporarily consider the end point
      to lack directionality. If the start point has
      directionality but the end point doesn't, then the end
      point uses the start point's directionality. If the end
      point has directionality but the start point doesn't,
      then the start point uses the end point's directionality.
      Otherwise, set the directionality for the path segment's
      start and end points to align with the positive x-axis in
      user space.</li>

      <li>As mentioned in <a href="painting.html#StrokeProperties">Stroke Properties</a>,
      linecaps must be painted for zero length subpaths when
      <a>'stroke-linecap'</a> has a value of
      <span class='prop-value'>round</span> or
      <span class='prop-value'>square</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The S/s commands indicate that the first control point of
    the given cubic Bézier segment is calculated by
    reflecting the previous path segments second control point
    relative to the current point. The exact math is as
    follows. If the current point is (<var>curx</var>, <var>cury</var>) and the
    second control point of the previous path segment is
    (<var>oldx2</var>, <var>oldy2</var>), then the reflected point (i.e., (<var>newx1</var>,
    <var>newy1</var>), the first control point of the current path
    segment) is: 
<pre>
(newx1, newy1) = (curx - (oldx2 - curx), cury - (oldy2 - cury))
               = (2*curx - oldx2, 2*cury - oldy2)
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>A non-positive radius value is an error.</li>

  <li>Unrecognized contents within a path data stream (i.e.,
  contents that are not part of the path data grammar) is an
  error.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ArcImplementationNotes">Elliptical arc implementation notes</h2>

<div class='math'>

<h3 id="ArcSyntax">Elliptical arc syntax</h3>

<p>An elliptical arc is a particular path command. As
such, it is described by the following parameters in order:</p>

<p>(<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) are the absolute coordinates of the
current point on the path, obtained from the last two
parameters of the previous path command.</p>

<p><var>r<sub>x</sub></var>
and <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
are the radii of the ellipse (also known as its semi-major and
semi-minor axes).</p>

<p><var>φ</var> is the angle from the x-axis of the current coordinate
system to the x-axis of the ellipse.</p>

<p><var>f<sub>A</sub></var> is
the large arc flag, and is 0
if an arc spanning less than or equal to 180 degrees is chosen, or 1
if an arc spanning greater than 180 degrees is chosen.</p>

<p><var>f<sub>S</sub></var> is
the sweep flag, and is 0 if
the line joining center to arc sweeps through decreasing
angles, or 1 if it sweeps
through increasing angles.</p>

<p>(<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>) are the absolute coordinates of the
final point of the arc.</p>

<p>This parameterization of elliptical arcs will be referred to
as <em>endpoint parameterization</em>. One of the
advantages of endpoint parameterization is that it permits a
consistent path syntax in which all path commands end in the
coordinates of the new "current point". The following
notes give rules and formulas to help implementers deal with
endpoint parameterization.</p>

<h3 id="ArcOutOfRangeParameters">Out-of-range parameters</h3>

<p>Arbitrary numerical values are permitted for all elliptical
arc parameters, but where these values are invalid or
out-of-range, an implementation must make sense of them as
follows:</p>

<p>If the endpoints (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>)
and (<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>) are identical, then this is
equivalent to omitting the elliptical arc segment entirely.</p>

<p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or
<var>r<sub>y</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
then this arc is treated as a straight line segment
(a "lineto") joining the endpoints.</p>

<p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var> or <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
have negative signs, these are dropped; the absolute value is
used instead.</p>

<p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var>, <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
and <var>φ</var> are such that there is no solution
(basically, the ellipse is not big enough to reach
from (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>)
to (<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>))
then the ellipse is scaled up
uniformly until there is exactly one solution (until the
ellipse is just big enough).</p>

<p><var>φ</var> is taken mod 360 degrees.</p>

<p>Any nonzero value for either of the flags <var>f<sub>A</sub></var>
or <var>f<sub>S</sub></var> is taken to mean the value 1.</p>

<p>This forgiving yet consistent treatment of out-of-range
values ensures that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inevitable approximations arising from computer
  arithmetic cannot cause a valid set of values written by one
  SVG implementation to be treated as invalid when read by
  another SVG implementation. This would otherwise be a
  problem for common boundary cases such as a semicircular
  arc.</li>

  <li>Continuous animations that cause parameters to pass
  through invalid values are not a problem. The motion
  remains continuous.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ArcParameterizationAlternatives">Parameterization alternatives</h3>

<p>An arbitrary point (<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) on the elliptical
arc can be described by the 2-dimensional matrix equation:</p>

<p>(<var>c<sub>x</sub></var>,&nbsp;<var>c<sub>y</sub></var>) are
the coordinates of the center of the ellipse.</p>

<p><var>r<sub>x</sub></var> and <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
are the radii of the ellipse (also known as its semi-major and
semi-minor axes).</p>

<p><var>θ</var> is the angle from the

ellipse.</p>

<p><var>θ</var> ranges from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><var>θ</var><sub>1</sub> which is
  the start angle of the elliptical arc prior to the stretch and
  rotate operations.</li>

  <li><var>θ</var><sub>2</sub> which is
  the end angle of the elliptical arc prior to the stretch and
  rotate operations.</li>

  <li>Δ<var>θ</var> which is the difference between these
  two angles.</li>
</ul>

<p>If one thinks of an ellipse as a circle that has been
stretched and then rotated, then <var>θ</var><sub>1</sub>,
<var>θ</var><sub>2</sub> and Δ<var>θ</var>
are the start angle, end angle and sweep angle, respectively
of the arc prior to the stretch and rotate operations.
This leads to an alternate parameterization which is common
among graphics APIs, which will be referred to as <em>center
parameterization</em>. In the next sections, formulas are
given for mapping in both directions between center
parameterization and endpoint parameterization.</p>

    <p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or

    radii corrections in this section, equation (F.6.5.2) for the
    center of the ellipse always has at least one solution (i.e.
    the radicand is never negative). In the case that the
    radii are scaled up using equation (F.6.6.3), the radicand of
    (F.6.5.2) is zero and there is exactly one solution for the
    center of the ellipse.</p>

<h2 id="TextSelectionImplementationNotes">Text selection implementation notes</h2>

<p>The following implementation notes describe the algorithm
for deciding which characters are selected during a <a
href="text.html#TextSelection">text selection</a>
operation.</p>

<p>As the text selection operation occurs (e.g., while the user
clicks and drags the mouse to identify the selection), the user
agent determines a <em>start selection position</em> and an
<em>end selection position</em>, each of which represents a
position in the text string between two characters. After
determining start selection position and end selection
position, the user agent selects the appropriate characters,
where the resulting text selection consists of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no selection or</li>

  <li>a <em>start character</em>, an <em>end character</em>
  (possibly the same character), and all of the characters
  within the same <a>'text'</a> element whose position
  in the DOM is logically between the start character and end
  character.</li>
</ul>

<p>On systems with pointer devices, to determine the <em>start
selection position</em>, the SVG user agent determines which
boundary between characters corresponding to rendered glyphs is
the best target (e.g., closest) based on the current pointer
location at the time of the event that initiates the selection
operation (e.g., the mouse down event). The user agent then
tracks the completion of the selection operation (e.g., the
mouse drag, followed ultimately by the mouse up). At the end of
the selection operation, the user agent determines which
boundary between characters is the best target (e.g., closest)
for the <em>end selection position</em>.</p>

<p>If no character reordering has occurred due to <a
href="text.html#RelationshipWithBiDirectionality">bidirectionality</a>,
then the selection consists of all characters between the
<em>start selection position</em> and <em>end selection
position</em>. For example, if a <a>'text'</a> element contains the
string "abcdef" and the start selection position and end
selection positions are 0 and 3 respectively (assuming the left
side of the "a" is position zero), then the selection will
consist of "abc".</p>

<p>When the user agent is implementing selection of
bidirectional text, and when the selection starts (or ends)
between characters which are not contiguous in logical order,
then there might be multiple potential combinations of
characters that can be considered part of the selection. The
algorithms to choose among the combinations of potential
selection options shall choose the selection option which most
closely matches the text string's visual rendering order.</p>
<p>When multiple characters map inseparably to a given set of
one or more glyphs, the user agent can either disallow the
selection to start in the middle of the glyph set or can
attempt to allocate portions of the area taken up by the glyph
set to the characters that correspond to the glyph.</p>

<p>For systems which support pointer devices such as a mouse,
the user agent is required to provide a mechanism for selecting
text even when the given text has associated event handlers or
links, which might block text selection due to event processing
precedence rules (see <a href="interact.html#PointerEvents">Pointer events</a>).
One implementation option: For platforms which support a pointer
device such as a mouse, the user agent may provide for a small
additional region around character cells which initiates text
selection operations but does not initiate event handlers or
links.</p>

<h2 id="PrintingImplementationNotes">Printing implementation notes</h2>

<p>For user agents which support both zooming on display
devices and printing, it is recommended that the default
printing option produce printed output that reflects the
display device's current view of the current SVG document
fragment (assuming there is no media-specific styling), taking
into account any zooming and panning done by the user, the
current state of animation, and any document changes due to DOM
and scripting. Thus, if the user zooms into a particular area
of a map on the display device and then requests a hardcopy,
the hardcopy should show the same view of the map as appears on
the display device. If a user pauses an animation and prints,
the hardcopy should show the same graphics as the currently
paused picture on the display device. If scripting has added or
removed elements from the document, then the hardcopy should
reflect the same changes that would be reflected on the
display.</p>

<p>When an SVG document is rendered on a static-only device
such as a printer which does not support SVG's animation and
scripting and facilities, then the user agent shall ignore any
animation and scripting elements in the document and render the
remaining graphics elements according to the rules in this
specification.</p>
