<h1>Implementation Requirements</h1>

    <p class="normativity"><strong>This appendix is normative.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The following are notes about implementation requirements
    corresponding to various features in the SVG language.</p>

<h2 id="ErrorProcessing">Error processing</h2>

    <p>There are various scenarios where an SVG document fragment
    is technically <span class="SVG-Term">in error</span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the content does not conform to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0
      specification</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-XML10">XML10</a>], such as the
      use of incorrect XML syntax</li>
      <li>When an element or attribute is encountered in the
      document which is not part of the <a href="svgdtd.html">SVG
      DTD</a> and which is not properly identified as being part of
      another namespace (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/"><cite>Namespaces in XML</cite></a>
      [<a href="refs.html#ref-XML-NS">XML-NS</a>])</li>
      <li>When an element has an attribute or property value which
      is not permissible according to this specification</li>
      <li>Other situations that are described as being <em>in
      error</em> in this specification</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A document can go in and out of error over time. For
    example, document changes from the <a href="svgdom.html">SVG
    DOM</a> or from <a href="animate.html">animation</a> can cause
    a document to become <em>in error</em> and a further change can
    cause the document to become correct again.</p>
    <p>The following error processing shall occur when a document
    is in error:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The document shall be rendered up to, but not including,
        the first element which has an error. Exceptions: 
        <ul>
          <li>If a <a>'path'</a> element is the
          first element which has an error and the only errors are
          in the <a href="paths.html#PathData">path data</a>
          specification, then render the <a>'path'</a> up to the point of the
          path data error. For related information, see <a
          href="implnote.html#PathElementImplementationNotes"><span
          class="element-name">'path'</span> element implementation
          notes</a>.</li>
          <li>If a <a>'polyline'</a> or <a>'polygon'</a> element is the
          first element which has an error and the only errors are
          within the <a>'polyline/points'</a> attribute, then render
          the <a>'polyline'</a> or <a>'polygon'</a> up to the segment
          with the error.</li>
        </ul>
        This approach will provide a visual clue to the user or
        developer about where the error might be in the document.
      </li>
      <li>If the document has animations, the animations shall stop
      at the point at which an error is encountered and the visual
      presentation of the document shall reflect the animated
      status of the document at the point the error was
      encountered.</li>
      <li>A highly perceivable indication of error shall occur. For
      visual rendering situations, an example of an indication of
      error would be to render a translucent colored pattern such
      as a checkerboard on top of the area where the SVG content is
      rendered.</li>
      <li>If the user agent has access to an error reporting
      capability such as status bar, it is recommended that the
      user agent provide whatever additional detail it can to
      enable the user or developer to quickly find the source of
      the error. For example, the user agent might provide an error
      message along with a line number and character number at
      which the error was encountered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because of situations where a block of scripting changes
    might cause a given SVG document fragment to go into and out of
    error, error processing shall occur only at times when document
    presentation (e.g., rendering to the display device) is
    updated. In particular, error processing shall be disabled
    whenever redraw has been suspended via DOM calls to
    <a>SVGSVGElement::suspendRedraw</a>.</p>

<h2 id="VersionControl">Version control</h2>

    <p>The SVG user agent must verify the reference to the PUBLIC
    identifier in the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> statement or
    the namespace reference in the <span class='attr-name'>'xmlns'</span> attribute on
    the <a>'svg'</a> element to ensure that
    the given document (or document fragment) identifies a version
    of the SVG language which the SVG user agent supports. If the
    version information is missing or the version information
    indicates a version of the SVG language which the SVG user
    agent does not support, then the SVG user agent is not required
    to render that document or fragment. In particular, it is not
    required that an SVG user agent attempt to render future
    versions of the SVG language. If the user environment provides
    such an option, the user agent should alert or otherwise notify
    the user that the version of the file is not supported and
    suggest an alternate processing option (e.g., installing an
    updated version of the user agent) if such an option
    exists.</p>
    <p>An SVG user agent which supports the SVG Recommendation
    should alert or otherwise notify the user whenever it
    encounters an SVG document (or document fragment) whose
    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> statement or corresponding
    <span class='attr-name'>'xmlns'</span> attribute corresponds to a working draft
    version of the SVG specification. All content based on working
    drafts of this specification should be updated to the SVG
    Recommendation.</p>

<h2 id="RangeClamping">Clamping values which are restricted to a particular range</h2>

    <p>Some numeric attribute and property values have restricted
    ranges, such as color component values. When out-of-range
    values are provided, the user agent shall defer any error
    checking until after presentation time, as composited actions
    might produce intermediate values which are out-of-range but
    final values which are within range.</p>
    <p>Color values are not in error if they are out-of-range, even
    if final computations produce an out-of-range color value at
    presentation time. It is recommended that user agents clamp
    color values to the nearest color value (possibly determined by
    simple clipping) which the system can process as late as
    possible (e.g., presentation time), although it is acceptable
    for user agents to clamp color values as early as parse time.
    Thus, implementation dependencies might preclude consistent
    behavior across different systems when out-of-range color
    values are used.</p>
    <p>Opacity values out-of-range are not in error and should be
    clamped to the range 0 to 1 at the time which opacity values
    have to be processed (e.g., at presentation time or when it is
    necessary to perform intermediate filter effect
    calculations).</p>

<h2 id="PathElementImplementationNotes"><span class="element-name">'path'</span> element implementation notes</h2>

    <p>A conforming SVG user agent must implement path rendering as
    follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Error handling: 
        <ul>
          <li>The general rule for error handling in path data is
          that the SVG user agent shall render a <a>'path'</a> element up
          to (but not including) the path command containing the
          first error in the path data specification. This will
          provide a visual clue to the user or developer about
          where the error might be in the path data specification.
          This rule will greatly discourage generation of invalid
          SVG path data.</li>
          <li>If a path data command contains an incorrect set of
          parameters, then the given path data command is rendered
          up to and including the last correctly defined path
          segment, even if that path segment is a sub-component of
          a compound path data command, such as a "lineto" with
          several pairs of coordinates. For example, for the path
          data string <span class='attr-value'>'M 10,10 L 20,20,30'</span>,
          there is an odd number of parameters for the "L" command, which requires an even
          number of parameters. The user agent is required to draw
          the line from (10,10) to (20,20) and then perform error
          reporting since <span class='attr-value'>'L 20 20'</span>
          is the last correctly defined segment of the path data specification.</li>
          <li>Wherever possible, all SVG user agents shall report
          all errors to the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Markers, directionality and zero-length path segments: 
        <ul>
          <li>If markers are specified, then a marker is drawn on
          every applicable vertex, even if the given vertex is the
          end point of a zero-length path segment and even if
          "moveto" commands follow each other.</li>
          <li>Certain line-capping and line-joining situations and
          markers require that a path segment have directionality
          at its start and end points. Zero-length path segments
          have no directionality. In these cases, the following
          algorithm is used to establish directionality: to
          determine the directionality of the start point of a
          zero-length path segment, go backwards in the path data
          specification within the current subpath until you find a
          segment which has directionality at its end point (e.g.,
          a path segment with non-zero length) and use its ending
          direction; otherwise, temporarily consider the start
          point to lack directionality. Similarly, to determine the
          directionality of the end point of a zero-length path
          segment, go forwards in the path data specification
          within the current subpath until you find a segment which
          has directionality at its start point (e.g., a path
          segment with non-zero length) and use its starting
          direction; otherwise, temporarily consider the end point
          to lack directionality. If the start point has
          directionality but the end point doesn't, then the end
          point uses the start point's directionality. If the end
          point has directionality but the start point doesn't,
          then the start point uses the end point's directionality.
          Otherwise, set the directionality for the path segment's
          start and end points to align with the positive x-axis in
          user space.</li>
          <li>As mentioned in <a href="painting.html#StrokeProperties">Stroke Properties</a>,
          linecaps must be painted for zero length subpaths when
          <a>'stroke-linecap'</a> has a value of
          <span class='prop-value'>round</span> or
          <span class='prop-value'>square</span>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The S/s commands indicate that the first control point of
        the given cubic B&eacute;zier segment is calculated by
        reflecting the previous path segments second control point
        relative to the current point. The exact math is as
        follows. If the current point is (<var>curx</var>, <var>cury</var>) and the
        second control point of the previous path segment is
        (<var>oldx2</var>, <var>oldy2</var>), then the reflected point (i.e., (<var>newx1</var>,
        <var>newy1</var>), the first control point of the current path
        segment) is: 
<pre>
(newx1, newy1) = (curx - (oldx2 - curx), cury - (oldy2 - cury))
               = (2*curx - oldx2, 2*cury - oldy2)
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>A non-positive radius value is an error.</li>
      <li>Unrecognized contents within a path data stream (i.e.,
      contents that are not part of the path data grammar) is an
      error.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="ArcSyntax">Elliptical arc syntax</h3>

    <p>An elliptical arc is a particular path command. As
    such, it is described by the following parameters in order:</p>
    <p>(<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) are the absolute coordinates of the
    current point on the path, obtained from the last two
    parameters of the previous path command.</p>
    <p><var>r<sub>x</sub></var>
    and <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
    are the radii of the ellipse (also known as its semi-major and
    semi-minor axes).</p>
    <p><var>φ</var> is the angle from the x-axis of the current coordinate
    system to the x-axis of the ellipse.</p>
    <p><var>f<sub>A</sub></var> is
    the large arc flag, and is 0
    if an arc spanning less than or equal to 180 degrees is chosen, or 1
    if an arc spanning greater than 180 degrees is chosen.</p>
    <p><var>f<sub>S</sub></var> is
    the sweep flag, and is 0 if
    the line joining center to arc sweeps through decreasing
    angles, or 1 if it sweeps
    through increasing angles.</p>
    <p>(<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>) are the absolute coordinates of the
    final point of the arc.</p>
    <p>This parameterization of elliptical arcs will be referred to
    as <em>endpoint parameterization</em>. One of the
    advantages of endpoint parameterization is that it permits a
    consistent path syntax in which all path commands end in the
    coordinates of the new "current point". The following
    notes give rules and formulas to help implementers deal with
    endpoint parameterization.</p>

<h3 id="ArcOutOfRangeParameters">Out-of-range parameters</h3>

    <p>Arbitrary numerical values are permitted for all elliptical
    arc parameters, but where these values are invalid or
    out-of-range, an implementation must make sense of them as
    follows:</p>
    <p>If the endpoints (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>)
    and (<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>) are identical, then this is
    equivalent to omitting the elliptical arc segment entirely.</p>
    <p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or
    <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
    then this arc is treated as a straight line segment
    (a "lineto") joining the endpoints.</p>
    <p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var> or <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
    have negative signs, these are dropped; the absolute value is
    used instead.</p>
    <p>If <var>r<sub>x</sub></var>, <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
    and <var>φ</var> are such that there is no solution
    (basically, the ellipse is not big enough to reach
    from (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>)
    to (<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>))
    then the ellipse is scaled up
    uniformly until there is exactly one solution (until the
    ellipse is just big enough).</p>
    <p><var>φ</var> is taken mod 360 degrees.</p>
    <p>Any nonzero value for either of the flags <var>f<sub>A</sub></var>
    or <var>f<sub>S</sub></var> is taken to mean the value 1.</p>
    <p>This forgiving yet consistent treatment of out-of-range
    values ensures that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The inevitable approximations arising from computer
      arithmetic cannot cause a valid set of values written by one
      SVG implementation to be treated as invalid when read by
      another SVG implementation. This would otherwise be a
      problem for common boundary cases such as a semicircular
      arc.</li>
      <li>Continuous animations that cause parameters to pass
      through invalid values are not a problem. The motion
      remains continuous.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="ArcParameterizationAlternatives">Parameterization alternatives</h3>

    <p>An arbitrary point (<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) on the elliptical
    arc can be described by the 2-dimensional matrix equation</p>
    <table summary="equation F.6.3.1" width="90%" border="0"
    cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img
        alt="equation F.6.3.1"
        src="images/implnote/arcs/image002.png" /></td>
        <td align="right">(F.6.3.1)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>(<var>c<sub>x</sub></var>,&nbsp;<var>c<sub>y</sub></var>) are
    the coordinates of the center of the ellipse.</p>
    <p><var>r<sub>x</sub></var> and <var>r<sub>y</sub></var>
    are the radii of the ellipse (also known as its semi-major and
    semi-minor axes).</p>
    <p><var>θ</var> is the angle from the
    x-axis of the current coordinate system to the x-axis of the
    ellipse.</p>
    <p><var>θ</var> ranges from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><var>θ</var><sub>1</sub> which is
      the start angle of the elliptical arc prior to the stretch and
      rotate operations.</li>
      <li><var>θ</var><sub>2</sub> which is
      the end angle of the elliptical arc prior to the stretch and
      rotate operations.</li>
      <li>Δ<var>θ</var> which is the difference between these
      two angles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If one thinks of an ellipse as a circle that has been
    stretched and then rotated, then <var>θ</var><sub>1</sub>,
    <var>θ</var><sub>2</sub> and Δ<var>θ</var>
    are the start angle, end angle and sweep angle, respectively
    of the arc prior to the stretch and rotate operations.
    This leads to an alternate parameterization which is common
    among graphics APIs, which will be referred to as <em>center
    parameterization</em>. In the next sections, formulas are
    given for mapping in both directions between center
    parameterization and endpoint parameterization.</p>

<p>The equations simplify after a translation which
places the origin at the midpoint of the line joining
(<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) to
(<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<var>y</var><sub>2</sub>), followed by
a rotation to line up the coordinate axes with the axes of the ellipse.
All transformed coordinates will be written with primes. They are

    radii corrections in this section, equation (F.6.5.2) for the
    center of the ellipse always has at least one solution (i.e.
    the radicand is never negative).&nbsp; In the case that the
    radii are scaled up using equation (F.6.6.3), the radicand of
    (F.6.5.2) is zero and there is exactly one solution for the

<h2 id="TextSelectionImplementationNotes">Text selection implementation notes</h2>

    <p>The following implementation notes describe the algorithm
    for deciding which characters are selected during a <a
    href="text.html#TextSelection">text selection</a>
    operation.</p>
    <p>As the text selection operation occurs (e.g., while the user
    clicks and drags the mouse to identify the selection), the user
    agent determines a <em>start selection position</em> and an
    <em>end selection position</em>, each of which represents a
    position in the text string between two characters. After
    determining start selection position and end selection
    position, the user agent selects the appropriate characters,
    where the resulting text selection consists of either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>no selection or</li>
      <li>a <em>start character</em>, an <em>end character</em>
      (possibly the same character), and all of the characters
      within the same <a>'text'</a> element whose position
      in the DOM is logically between the start character and end
      character.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On systems with pointer devices, to determine the <em>start
    selection position</em>, the SVG user agent determines which
    boundary between characters corresponding to rendered glyphs is
    the best target (e.g., closest) based on the current pointer
    location at the time of the event that initiates the selection
    operation (e.g., the mouse down event). The user agent then
    tracks the completion of the selection operation (e.g., the
    mouse drag, followed ultimately by the mouse up). At the end of
    the selection operation, the user agent determines which
    boundary between characters is the best target (e.g., closest)
    for the <em>end selection position</em>.</p>
    <p>If no character reordering has occurred due to <a
    href="text.html#RelationshipWithBiDirectionality">bidirectionality</a>,
    then the selection consists of all characters between the
    <em>start selection position</em> and <em>end selection
    position</em>. For example, if a <a>'text'</a> element contains the
    string "abcdef" and the start selection position and end
    selection positions are 0 and 3 respectively (assuming the left
    side of the "a" is position zero), then the selection will
    consist of "abc".</p>
    <p>When the user agent is implementing selection of
    bidirectional text, and when the selection starts (or ends)
    between characters which are not contiguous in logical order,
    then there might be multiple potential combinations of
    characters that can be considered part of the selection. The
    algorithms to choose among the combinations of potential
    selection options shall choose the selection option which most
    closely matches the text string's visual rendering order.</p>
    <p>When multiple characters map inseparably to a given set of
    one or more glyphs, the user agent can either disallow the
    selection to start in the middle of the glyph set or can
    attempt to allocate portions of the area taken up by the glyph
    set to the characters that correspond to the glyph.</p>
    <p>For systems which support pointer devices such as a mouse,
    the user agent is required to provide a mechanism for selecting
    text even when the given text has associated event handlers or
    links, which might block text selection due to event processing
    precedence rules (see <a
    href="interact.html#PointerEvents">Pointer events</a>). One
    implementation option: For platforms which support a pointer
    device such as a mouse, the user agent may provide for a small
    additional region around character cells which initiates text
    selection operations but does not initiate event handlers or
    links.</p>

<h2 id="PrintingImplementationNotes">Printing implementation notes</h2>

    <p>For user agents which support both zooming on display
    devices and printing, it is recommended that the default
    printing option produce printed output that reflects the
    display device's current view of the current SVG document
    fragment (assuming there is no media-specific styling), taking
    into account any zooming and panning done by the user, the
    current state of animation, and any document changes due to DOM
    and scripting. Thus, if the user zooms into a particular area
    of a map on the display device and then requests a hardcopy,
    the hardcopy should show the same view of the map as appears on
    the display device. If a user pauses an animation and prints,
    the hardcopy should show the same graphics as the currently
    paused picture on the display device. If scripting has added or
    removed elements from the document, then the hardcopy should
    reflect the same changes that would be reflected on the
    display.</p>
    <p>When an SVG document is rendered on a static-only device
    such as a printer which does not support SVG's animation and
    scripting and facilities, then the user agent shall ignore any
    animation and scripting elements in the document and render the
    remaining graphics elements according to the rules in this
    specification.</p>
