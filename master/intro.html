<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="AboutSVG">About SVG</h2>

<p>This specification defines the features and syntax for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>.</p>

<p>SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics.
As a standalone format or when mixed with other XML, it uses the
XML syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-XML10">XML10</a>].
When mixed with HTML5, it uses the HTML5 syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-HTML">HTML</a>].
SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic
shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves),
images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled,
transformed and composited into previously rendered objects.
The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping
paths, alpha masks, filter effects and template objects.</p>

<p>SVG drawings can be <a href="interact.html">interactive</a>
and <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/">dynamic</a>. <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/">Animations</a>
can be defined and triggered
either declaratively (i.e., by embedding SVG animation elements
in SVG content) or via scripting.</p>

<p>Sophisticated applications of SVG are possible by use of a
supplemental scripting language which accesses
<a href="svgdom.html">SVG Document Object Model (DOM)</a>, which
provides complete access to all elements, attributes and
properties. A rich set of <a href="interact.html#SVGEvents">event handlers</a>
such as <a>'onmouseover'</a> and <a>'onclick'</a> can be assigned to any SVG
graphical object.
Because of its <a href="intro.html#W3CCompatibility">compatibility and
leveraging of other Web standards</a>, features like
<a href="interact.html">scripting</a> can be done on HTML and SVG
elements simultaneously within the same Web page.</p>

<p>SVG is a language for rich graphical content. For
accessibility reasons, if there is an original source document
containing higher-level structure and semantics, it is
recommended that the higher-level information be made available
somehow, either by making the original source document
available, or making an alternative version available in an
alternative format which conveys the higher-level information,
or by using SVG's facilities to include the higher-level
information within the SVG content. For suggested techniques in
achieving greater accessibility, see
<a href="access.html">Accessibility</a>.</p>

<h2 id="W3CCompatibility">Compatibility with other standards efforts</h2>

<p>SVG leverages and integrates with other W3C specifications
and standards efforts, as described in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SVG can be integrated with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> either by using SVG in HTML or by using HTML in SVG, in both cases either by inclusion or reference. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/svg-integration/">SVG Integration</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG is an application of XML and is compatible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0</a> and with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/">Namespaces in XML</a> specification. However, when SVG content is included in HTML document, the HTML syntax applies and may not be compatible with XML. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/svg-integration/">SVG Integration</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG content is styled with CSS. See <a href="styling.html">Styling with CSS</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG includes a complete Document Object Model (DOM) and
  extends <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/"><cite>DOM4</cite></a>.
  The SVG DOM has a high level of compatibility and consistency
  with the HTML DOM that is defined in the DOM Level 1
  specification. Additionally, the SVG DOM supports and
  incorporates many of the facilities described in
  DOM Level 2 and 3, including the CSS object model and event
  handling
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM2STYLE">DOM2STYLE</a>]
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS">DOM3EVENTS</a>].
  <p class="issue" data-issue="1">Clarify what DOM version is used and indicate that SVG/HTML can be scripted with a single API.</p>
  </li>

  <li>SVG incorporates some features and approaches that are
  part of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SMIL3-20081201/">SMIL 3</a>, including
  the <a>'switch'</a> element and the <a>'systemLanguage'</a>
  attribute.</li>

  <li>SVG is compatible with W3C work on internationalization.
  References (W3C and otherwise) include: [<a
  href="refs.html#ref-UNICODE">UNICODE</a>]
  and [<a href="refs.html#ref-CHARMOD">CHARMOD</a>].</li>

  <li>SVG is compatible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C work on Web Accessibility</a>.
  Also, see <a href="access.html">Accessibility Support</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>Within this specification, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"><cite>Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</cite></a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC2119">RFC2119</a>].
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

<p>At times, this specification recommends good practice for
authors and user agents. These recommendations are not
normative and conformance with this specification does not
depend on their realization. These recommendations contain the
expression "We recommend ...", "This specification recommends
...", or some similar wording.</p>
