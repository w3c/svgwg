<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="AboutSVG">About SVG</h2>

<p>This specification defines the features and syntax for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>.</p>

<p>SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics.
As a standalone format or when mixed with other XML, it uses the
XML syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-xml">xml</a>].
SVG code used inside HTML documents uses the HTML syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-html">HTML</a>].
SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic
shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves),
images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled,
transformed and composited.
The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping
paths, alpha masks, filter effects and template objects.</p>

<p>SVG drawings can be <a href="interact.html">interactive</a>
and <a href="interact.html#ScriptElement">dynamic</a>. <a href="animate.html">Animations</a>
can be defined and triggered
either declaratively (i.e., by embedding SVG animation elements
in SVG content) or via scripting.</p>

<p>Sophisticated applications of SVG are possible by use of a
supplemental scripting language which accesses
<a href="types.html#SVGDOMOverview">SVG Document Object Model (DOM)</a>, which
provides complete access to all elements, attributes and
properties. A rich set of <a href="interact.html#SVGEvents">event handlers</a>
can be assigned to any SVG graphical object.
Within a web page, the same scripts can work on both HTML and SVG elements.
<a href="interact.html">Scripting</a>.
</p>

<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
SVG is useful for rich graphical presentation of information, including a number
of <a href="access.html">accessibility features that, used correctly</a>,
ensure the content can be used by the widest possible audience. But a direct
link to source data, where possible,
is helpful for many people to understand the content provided.
</p>

<h2 id="W3CCompatibility">Compatibility with other standards efforts</h2>

<p>SVG leverages and integrates with other W3C specifications
and standards efforts, as described in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SVG can be integrated with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a> either by using SVG in HTML or by using HTML in SVG, in both cases either by inclusion or reference.</li>

  <li>SVG is an application of XML and is compatible with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0</a> and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/">Namespaces in XML</a> specification. However, when SVG content is included in HTML document, the HTML syntax applies and may not be compatible with XML. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-integration/">SVG Integration</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG content is styled with CSS. See <a href="styling.html">Styling with CSS</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG includes a complete Document Object Model (DOM) and
  extends <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/"><cite>DOM4</cite></a>.
  The SVG DOM has a high level of compatibility and consistency
  with the HTML DOM.
  Additionally, the SVG DOM supports and
  incorporates many of the facilities described in
  the CSS object model and event handling
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-dom-level-2-style">dom-level-2-style</a>]
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-uievents">uievents</a>].
  </li>

  <li>SVG incorporates some features and approaches that are
  part of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SMIL3-20081201/">SMIL 3</a>, including
  the <a>'switch'</a> element and the <a>'systemLanguage'</a>
  attribute.</li>

  <li>SVG is compatible with W3C work on internationalization.
  References (W3C and otherwise) include: [<a
  href="refs.html#ref-unicode">UNICODE</a>]
  and [<a href="refs.html#ref-charmod">charmod</a>].</li>

  <li>SVG is compatible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C work on Web Accessibility</a>.
  See <a href="access.html">Accessibility Support</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="RelationshipToPrevious">Relationship to previous versions of this standard</h2>

This edition of the SVG standard has been developed based on, and built upon, the 1.1 edition released in 2003.
An intermediate version of SVG - named <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/">Tiny 1.2</a> - was released
in 2008. However it did not receive wide acceptance and there have been very few implementations of its
enhanced feature set. However there are some 1.2 features that have been implemented by many SVG implementations and
those have been incorporated as part of this specification. But otherwise, the SVG Working Group consider version
Tiny 1.2 to be a deprecated branch of the SVG standard.

<h2 id="ConformanceTerms">Normative Terminology</h2>

<p>Within this specification, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"><cite>Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</cite></a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-rfc2119">rfc2119</a>].
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

<p>At times, this specification recommends good practice for
authors and user agents.</p>
