<h1>Paths</h1>

<edit:with element='path'>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Paths represent the outline of a shape which can be filled,
stroked, used as a clipping path, or any combination of the
three. (See <a href="painting.html">Filling, Stroking and Paint
Servers</a> and <a href="masking.html">Clipping, Masking and
Compositing</a>.)</p>

<p class="issue" data-issue="1">Also they can be used by <a>'mpath'</a> and
<a>'textPath'</a>.</p>

<p>A path is described using the concept of a current point. In
an analogy with drawing on paper, the current point can be
thought of as the location of the pen. The position of the pen
can be changed, and the outline of a shape (open or closed) can
be traced by dragging the pen in either straight lines or
curves.</p>

<p>Paths represent the geometry of the outline of an object,
defined in terms of <em>moveto</em> (set a new current point),
<em>bearing</em> (set a new orientation), <em>lineto</em>
(draw a straight line), <em>curveto</em> (draw
a curve using a cubic Bézier), <em>arc</em> (elliptical
or circular arc) and <em>closepath</em> (close the current
shape by drawing a line to the last <em>moveto</em>) commands.
Compound paths (i.e., a path with multiple subpaths) are
possible to allow effects such as "donut holes" in objects.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the syntax, behavior and DOM
interfaces for SVG paths. Various implementation notes for SVG
paths can be found in <a
href="implnote.html#PathElementImplementationNotes"><span
class="element-name">'path'</span> element implementation
Notes</a> and <a
href="implnote.html#ArcImplementationNotes">Elliptical arc
implementation notes</a>.</p>

<p>A path is defined in SVG using the <a>'path'</a> element.</p>

<p>The <a>basic shapes</a> are all described in terms of what their
<dfn id="TermEquivalentPath">equivalent path</dfn> is, which is
what their shape is as a path.  (The equivalent path of a
<a>'path'</a> element is simply the path itself.)</p>

<h3 id="PathDataGeneralInformation">General information about path data</h3>

<p>A path is defined by including a <a>'path'</a>
element which contains a <span class='attr-value'>d="(path data)"</span>
attribute, where the <a>'d'</a> attribute contains the
<em>moveto</em>, <em>bearing</em>, <em>lineto</em>, <em>curveto</em> (both cubic and
quadratic Béziers), <em>arc</em> and <em>closepath</em>
instructions.</p>

<p><span class="example-ref">Example triangle01</span>
specifies a path in the shape of a triangle. (The
<strong>M</strong> indicates a <em>moveto</em>, the
<strong>L</strong>s indicate <em>lineto</em>s, and the
<strong>z</strong> indicates a <em>closepath</em>).</p>

<edit:example href='images/paths/triangle01.svg' link='yes' image='yes' name='triangle01' description="simple example of a 'path'"/>

<p>Path data can contain newline characters and thus can be
broken up into multiple lines to improve readability. Because
of line length limitations with certain related tools, it is
recommended that SVG generators split long path data strings
across multiple lines, with each line not exceeding 255
characters. Also note that newline characters are only allowed
at certain places within path data.</p>

<div class="issue" data-issue="3">
<p>The path data is defined to allow newline
characters, but it should be noted that newlines inside
attributes in markup will be normalized to space characters
while parsing.  If you wanted to, you could write</p>

<pre>&lt;path d="M 100,100&amp;#10;L 200,150"/&gt;</pre>

<p>but it's not likely that you'd want to.</p>
</div>

<p class="issue" data-issue="4">Are there tools that have line limits nowadays?
Do we still need to recommend generators to split up path data
at 255 characters?</p>

<p class="issue" data-issue="5">The sentence about newline characters being
allowed only at certain places makes it sound like these places
are different from where white space more generally is allowed,
but that's not the case.</p>

<p>The syntax of path data is concise in order to allow for
minimal file size and efficient downloads, since many SVG files
will be dominated by their path data. Some of the ways that SVG
attempts to minimize the size of path data are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All instructions are expressed as one character (e.g., a
  <em>moveto</em> is expressed as an <strong>M</strong>).</li>

  <li>Superfluous white space and separators such as commas can
  be eliminated (e.g., "M 100 100 L 200 200" contains
  unnecessary spaces and could be expressed more compactly as
  "M100 100L200 200").</li>

  <li>The command letter can be eliminated on subsequent
  commands if the same command is used multiple times in a row
  (e.g., you can drop the second "L" in "M 100 200 L 200 100 L
  -100 -200" and use "M 100 200 L 200 100 -100 -200"
  instead).</li>

  <li>For most commands there are absolute and relative
  versions available (uppercase means absolute coordinates,
  lowercase means relative coordinates).</li>

  <li>Alternate forms of <em>lineto</em> are available to
  optimize the special cases of horizontal and vertical lines
  (absolute and relative).</li>

  <li>Alternate forms of <em>curve</em> are available to
  optimize the special cases where some of the control points
  on the current segment can be determined automatically from
  the control points on the previous segment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The path data syntax is a prefix notation (i.e., commands
followed by parameters). The only allowable decimal point is a
Unicode 
U+0046 FULL STOP (".") character (also referred to in Unicode as
PERIOD, dot and decimal point) and no other delimiter
characters are allowed [<a href='refs.html#ref-UNICODE'>UNICODE</a>].
(For example, the following is an
invalid numeric value in a path data stream: "13,000.56".
Instead, say: "13000.56".)</p>

<p>For the relative versions of the commands, all coordinate
values are relative to the current point at the start of the
command.</p>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">

<p>Relative path commands are also influenced by the
current bearing, which is an angle set by the <em>bearing</em>
commands.  This allows for paths to be specified using a
style of "turtle graphics", where straight line and curved
path segments are placed with their starting point at a
tangent (or at some other angle) to the current bearing.</p>

</div>

<p>In the tables below, the following notation is used to
describe the syntax of a given path command:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(): grouping of parameters</li>
  <li>+: 1 or more of the given parameter(s) is required</li>
</ul>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">

<p>In the description of the path commands, <var>cpx</var> and
<var>cpy</var> represent the coordinates of the current point,
and <var>cb</var> represents the current bearing.</p>

</div>

<p>The following sections list the commands.  Those that
draw straight line segments include the <a href="paths.html#PathDataLinetoCommands">lineto commands</a>
(<strong>L</strong>, <strong>l</strong>,
<strong>H</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, <strong>V</strong> and <strong>v</strong>)
and the <a href="paths.html#PathDataClosePathCommand">close path commands</a>
(<strong>Z</strong> and <strong>z</strong>).  These three groups of commands draw curves:</p>
    
<ul>
  <li><a href="paths.html#PathDataCubicBezierCommands">Cubic
  Bézier commands</a> (<strong>C</strong>,
  <strong>c</strong>, <strong>S</strong> and
  <strong>s</strong>). A cubic Bézier segment is defined
  by a start point, an end point, and two control points.</li>

  <li><a
  href="paths.html#PathDataQuadraticBezierCommands">Quadratic
  Bézier commands</a> (<strong>Q</strong>,
  <strong>q</strong>, <strong>T</strong> and
  <strong>t</strong>). A quadratic Bézier segment is
  defined by a start point, an end point, and one control
  point.</li>

  <li><a
  href="paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands">Elliptical
  arc commands</a> (<strong>A</strong> and <strong>a</strong>).
  An elliptical arc segment draws a segment of an ellipse.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="PathDataMovetoCommands">The <strong>"moveto"</strong> commands</h3>

<p>The "moveto" commands (<strong>M</strong> or
<strong>m</strong>) establish a new current point. The effect
is as if the "pen" were lifted and moved to a new location. A
path data segment (if there is one) must begin with a "moveto"
command. Subsequent "moveto" commands (i.e., when the "moveto"
is not the first command) represent the start of a new
<em>subpath</em>:</p>

<table class="PathDataTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Parameters</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <td>
      Start a new sub-path at the given (x,y) coordinates.
      <strong>M</strong> (uppercase) indicates that absolute
      coordinates will follow; <strong>m</strong> (lowercase)
      indicates that relative coordinates will follow. If a moveto is
      followed by multiple pairs of coordinates, the subsequent pairs
      are treated as implicit lineto commands. Hence, implicit lineto
      commands will be relative if the moveto is relative, and
      absolute if the moveto is absolute. If a relative moveto
      (<strong>m</strong>) appears as the first element of the path,
      then it is treated as a pair of absolute coordinates. In this
      case, subsequent pairs of coordinates are treated as relative
      even though the initial moveto is interpreted as an absolute moveto.
    </td>

<var>x</var> sin <var>cb</var> + <var>y</var> cos <var>cb</var>).</p>

</div>

<h3 id="PathDataClosePathCommand">The <strong>"closepath"</strong> command</h3>

<p>The "closepath" (<strong>Z</strong> or <strong>z</strong>)
ends the current subpath and causes an automatic straight line
to be drawn from the current point to the initial point of the
current subpath. If a "closepath" is followed immediately by a
"moveto", then the "moveto" identifies the start point of the
next subpath. If a "closepath" is followed immediately by any
other command, then the next subpath starts at the same initial
point as the current subpath.</p>

<p>When a subpath ends in a "closepath," it differs in behavior
from what happens when "manually" closing a subpath via a
"lineto" command in how <a>'stroke-linejoin'</a>
and <a>'stroke-linecap'</a> are implemented. With "closepath", the end of the final segment
of the subpath is "joined" with the start of the initial
segment of the subpath using the current value of <a>'stroke-linejoin'</a>.
If you instead "manually" close the subpath via a "lineto"
command, the start of the first segment and the end of the last
segment are not joined but instead are each capped using the
current value of <a>'stroke-linecap'</a>.
At the end of the command, the new current point is set to the
initial point of the current subpath.</p>

<p><span class="example-ref">Example arcs01</span> shows some
simple uses of arc commands within a path.</p>

<edit:example href='images/paths/arcs01.svg' name='arcs01' description='arc commands in path data' image='yes' link='yes'/>

<p>The elliptical arc command draws a section of an ellipse
which meets the following constraints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the arc starts at the current point</li>
  <li>the arc ends at point (<strong>x</strong>,
  <strong>y</strong>)</li>
  <li>the ellipse has the two radii (<strong>rx</strong>,
  <strong>ry</strong>)</li>
  <li>the x-axis of the ellipse is rotated by
  <strong>x-axis-rotation</strong> relative to the x-axis of
  the current coordinate system.</li>
</ul>

<p>For most situations, there are actually four different arcs
(two different ellipses, each with two different arc sweeps)
that satisfy these constraints. <strong>large-arc-flag</strong>
and <strong>sweep-flag</strong> indicate which one of the four
arcs are drawn, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of the four candidate arc sweeps, two will represent an
  arc sweep of greater than or equal to 180 degrees (the
  "large-arc"), and two will represent an arc sweep of less
  than or equal to 180 degrees (the "small-arc"). If
  <strong>large-arc-flag</strong> is '1', then one of the two
  larger arc sweeps will be chosen; otherwise, if
  <strong>large-arc-flag</strong> is '0', one of the smaller
  arc sweeps will be chosen,</li>

  <li>If <strong>sweep-flag</strong> is '1', then the arc will
  be drawn in a "positive-angle" direction (i.e., the ellipse
  formula x=<strong>cx</strong>+<strong>rx</strong>*cos(theta)
  and y=<strong>cy</strong>+<strong>ry</strong>*sin(theta) is
  evaluated such that theta starts at an angle corresponding to
  the current point and increases positively until the arc
  reaches (x,y)). A value of 0 causes the arc to be drawn in a
  "negative-angle" direction (i.e., theta starts at an angle
  value corresponding to the current point and decreases until
  the arc reaches (x,y)).</li>
</ul>

<p>The following illustrates the four combinations of
<strong>large-arc-flag</strong> and <strong>sweep-flag</strong>
and the four different arcs that will be drawn based on the
values of these flags. For each case, the following path data
command was used:</p>

<pre>
&lt;path d="M 125,75 a100,50 0 ?,? 100,50"
      style="fill:none; stroke:red; stroke-width:6"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>where "?,?" is replaced by "0,0" "0,1" "1,0" and "1,1" to
generate the four possible cases.</p>

commands are:</p>

    control points.  The curve is drawn starting from (x1, y1),
    passing through each subsequent point, before stopping at
    the second-last point given.  The current point preceding the command
    provides the first control point of the curve and controls its tangent
    coming out of (x1, y1).  The final point of the command
    provides the final control point and controls the tangent
    of the curve coming in to the second-last point.
    <strong>R</strong> (uppercase) indicates that absolute coordinates
    will follows; <strong>r</strong> (lowercase) indicates that
    relative coordinates will follow.</p>

    is left at the second-last point of the command, i.e. the point
    at which the curve ends visually.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>When a relative <strong>r</strong>
command is used, each of the relative coordinate pairs
is computed as for those in an <strong>m</strong> command.
For example, the second control point of the curve – the first
listed in the command – is (<var>cpx</var> + <var>x1</var> cos <var>cb</var>
+ <var>y1</var> sin <var>cb</var>, <var>cpy</var> +
<var>x1</var> sin <var>cb</var> + <var>y1</var> cos <var>cb</var>).</p>

<p class="issue" data-issue="6">Should we broaden this and allow for a tension parameter
to be specified, and thus be cardinal spline rather than a Catmull-Rom spline?</p>

<p class="issue" data-issue="7">Should we allow for fewer than three coordinate pair arguments

above for how the current position is left at the second-last control
point.</p>

<h3 id="PathDataBearingCommands">The bearing commands</h3>

<p>The bearing commands (<strong>B</strong> or <strong>b</strong>)
set the current bearing, which influences the orientation of
subsequent relative path commands:</p>

<table class="PathDataTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Name</th>

    <td>Sets the current bearing.  The parameter is an angle
    in degrees, where 0 indicates the direction of the positive
    x-axis.  <strong>B</strong> (uppercase) sets
    the current bearing to the specified angle; <strong>b</strong>
    (lowercase) sets the current bearing to be the angle of the
    tangent at the end of the preceding path command plus the
    specified angle.  The current point is unaffected.
    Although multiple parameters may be specified, this usually
    will not be useful, as they could be combined into a single
    angle value.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>At the beginning of a path, the current bearing is 0, which
points in the direction of the positive x-axis.  The current
bearing remains unchanged until a <strong>B</strong> or
<strong>b</strong> command is encountered.  Since the relative
<strong>b</strong> command sets the current bearing relative
to the tangent at the end of the preceding path command,
it is possible to set the bearing to that tangent by using
"b 0".</p>

<p>The processing of the BNF must consume as much of a given
BNF production as possible, stopping at the point when a
character is encountered which no longer satisfies the
production. Thus, in the string "M 100-200", the first
coordinate for the "moveto" consumes the characters "100" and
stops upon encountering the minus sign because the minus sign
cannot follow a digit in the production of a "coordinate". The
result is that the first coordinate will be "100" and the
second coordinate will be "-200".</p>

<p>Similarly, for the string "M 0.6.5", the first coordinate of
the "moveto" consumes the characters "0.6" and stops upon
encountering the second decimal point because the production of
a "coordinate" only allows one decimal point. The result is
that the first coordinate will be "0.6" and the second
coordinate will be ".5".</p>

<p>Note that the BNF allows the path <a>'d'</a> attribute to be empty. This is not
an error, instead it disables rendering of the path.</p>

<h2 id="DistanceAlongAPath">Distance along a path</h2>

<p>Various operations, including <a
href="text.html#TextLayoutPath">text on a path</a> and <a
href="animate.html#AnimateMotionElement">motion animation</a>
and various <a href="painting.html#StrokeProperties">stroke
operations</a>, require that the user agent compute the
distance along the geometry of a graphics element, such as a <a>'path'</a>.</p>

<p>Exact mathematics exist for computing distance along a path,
but the formulas are highly complex and require substantial
computation. It is recommended that authoring products and user
agents employ algorithms that produce as precise results as
possible; however, to accommodate implementation differences
and to help distance calculations produce results that
approximate author intent, the <a>'pathLength'</a> attribute can be used
to provide the author's computation of the total length of the
path so that the user agent can scale distance-along-a-path
computations by the ratio of <a>'pathLength'</a> to the user agent's own
computed value for total path length.</p>

<p>A "moveto" or "bearing" operation within a <a>'path'</a> element is defined to have
zero length. Only the various "lineto", "curveto" and "arcto"
commands contribute to path length calculations.</p>
