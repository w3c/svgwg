<h1>Minimizing SVG File Sizes</h1>

<p class="normativity"><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></p>

<p>Considerable effort has been made to make SVG file sizes as
small as possible while still retaining the benefits of XML and
achieving compatibility and leverage with other W3C
specifications.</p>

<p>Here are some of the features in SVG that promote small file sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SVG's path data definition was defined to produce a
  compact data stream for vector graphics data: all commands
  are one character in length; relative coordinates are
  available; separator characters do not have to be supplied
  when tokens can be identified implicitly; smooth curve
  formulations are available (cubic Béziers, quadratic
  Béziers and elliptical arcs) to prevent the need to
  tesselate into polylines; and shortcut formulations exist for
  common forms of cubic Bézier segments, quadratic
  Bézier segments, and horizontal and vertical straight
  line segments so that the minimum number of coordinates need
  to be specified.</li>

  <li>Text can be specified using XML character data — no need
  to convert to outlines.</li>

  <li>SVG contains a facility for defining symbols once and
  referencing them multiple times using different visual
  attributes and different sizing, positioning, clipping and
  client-side filter effects</li>

  <li>User agents that support <a href="styling.html#StylingWithCSS">styling with CSS</a>
  can use CSS selectors and property inheritance to define commonly
  used sets of attributes once as named styles.</li>

  <li>Filter effects allow for compelling visual results and
  effects typically found only in image-authoring tools using
  small amounts of vector and/or raster data</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, HTTP/1.1 allows for compressed data to be
passed from server to client, which can result in significant
file size reduction. Here are some sample compression results
using <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">gzip
compression</a> on SVG documents [<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC1952">RFC1952</a>]:</p>

<table class='vert' summary="gzip compression results on SVG file sizes">
  <tr style="text-align: center">
    <th>Uncompressed
     SVG</th>
    <th>With gzip
     compression</th>
    <th>Compression
     ratio</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="text-align: right">
    <td>12,912</td>
    <td>2,463</td>
    <td>81%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="text-align: right">
    <td>12,164</td>
    <td>2,553</td>
    <td>79%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="text-align: right">
    <td>11,613</td>
    <td>2,617</td>
    <td>77%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="text-align: right">
    <td>18,689</td>
    <td>4,077</td>
    <td>78%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="text-align: right">
    <td>13,024</td>
    <td>2,041</td>
    <td>84%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A related issue is progressive rendering. Some SVG viewers will support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to display the first parts of an SVG document
  fragments as the remainder of the document is downloaded from
  the server; thus, the user will see part of the SVG drawing
  right away and interact with it, even if the SVG file size is
  large.</li>

  <li>delayed downloading of images and fonts. Just like some
  HTML browsers, some SVG viewers will download images and
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/fonts.html#q1">WebFonts</a>
  ([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>], section 15.1)
  last, substituting a temporary image and system fonts,
  respectively, until the given image and/or font is
  available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are techniques for minimizing SVG file sizes and
minimizing the time before the user is able to start
interacting with the SVG document fragments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Construct the SVG file such that any links which the user
  might want to click on are included at the beginning of the
  SVG file</li>

  <li>Use default values whenever possible rather than defining
  all attributes and properties explicitly.</li>

  <li>Take advantage of the <a href="paths.html#PathData">path
  data</a> data compaction facilities: use relative
  coordinates; use <em>h</em> and <em>v</em> for horizontal and
  vertical lines; use <em>s</em> or <em>t</em> for cubic and
  quadratic Bézier segments whenever possible; eliminate
  extraneous white space and separators.</li>

  <li>Utilize symbols if the same graphic appears multiple
  times in the document</li>

  <li>For user agents that support <a
  href="styling.html#StylingWithCSS">styling with CSS</a>,
  utilize CSS property inheritance and selectors to consolidate
  commonly used properties into named styles or to assign the
  properties to a parent <a>'g'</a> element.</li>

  <li>Utilize filter effects to help construct graphics via
  client-side graphics operations.</li>
</ul>
