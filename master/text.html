<h1>Text</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Text that is to be rendered as part of an SVG document fragment is
    specified using the <a>'text'</a> element. The text within a
    <a>'text'</a> element can be rendered:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>pre-formatted (with limited line wrapping),</li>
    <li>auto-wrapped (if a <a>content area</a> is provided),</li>
    <li>on a path (if a <a>'textPath'</a> element is provided).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The section <a href="text.html#TextLayout">Text layout</a> gives an
    introduction to text layout. It is followed by sections covering
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutContentArea">content areas</a> and
    the <a href="text.html#TextLayoutAlgorithm">algorithm</a> for
    laying out text within a <a>content area</a>.
    The specialized layout rules corresponding to text that is
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutPre">pre-formatted</a>,
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutAuto">auto-wrapped</a>, and
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutPath">on a path</a>
    are then addressed in individual sections.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Rules for text layout in SVG 1.1 are mostly defined within the SVG
    1.1 specification. The rules mirror to a large extent those found
    in CSS. In SVG 2, the dependence on CSS is more explicit. In
    practice the resulting layout is the same. The change to directly
    relying on CSS specifications simplifies the SVG specification
    while making it more obvious that rendering agents can use the
    same code to render both text in HTML and in SVG. In particular,
    SVG 2 auto-wrapped text is based on CSS text layout.
  </p>

  <p>
    SVG's <a>'text'</a> elements are rendered like other graphics
    elements. Thus, <a href="coords.html">coordinate system
    transformations</a>, <a href="painting.html">painting</a>,
    <a href="render.html#ClippingAndMasking">clipping</a> and
    <a href="render.html#ClippingAndMasking">masking</a> features apply to
    <a>'text'</a> elements in the same way as they apply to
    <a>shapes</a> such as
    <a href="paths.html">paths</a> and <a href="shapes.html#RectElement">rectangles</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    SVG text supports advanced typographic features including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>choice of typeface,</li>

    <li>use of discretionary, historical, or stylistic ligatures,</li>

    <li>text decorations (underlining, over-lining, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    SVG text supports international text processing needs such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>horizontal and vertical orientation of text,</li>

    <li>left-to-right or bidirectional text (i.e., languages
    which intermix right-to-left and left-to-right text, such as
    Arabic and Hebrew),</li>

    <li>
      complex text layout where: there is not always a one-to-one
      correspondence between characters and glyphs, characters
      may change shape depending on location (e.g. Arabic), and
      characters may be reordered or combined depending on context
      (e.g. Devanagari),
    </li>

    <li>
      glyph alignment to different baselines (<em>alphabetic</em> for
      western scripts, <em>hanging</em> for northern indic scripts,
      and <em>ideographic</em> for far-eastern scripts).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Multi-language SVG content is possible by
    <a href="struct.html#SwitchElement">substituting different
    text strings based on the user's preferred language</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The characters to be drawn are expressed as
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#syntax">character data</a> ([<a href="refs.html#ref-xml">xml</a>],
    section 2.4) inside the <a>'text'</a> element. As a result:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Text data in SVG content is readily accessible to the visually
      impaired (see <a href="access.html">Accessibility
      Support</a>).
    </li>

    <li>
      In many viewing scenarios, the user will be able to search for
      and select text strings and copy selected text strings to the
      system clipboard (see <a href="text.html#TextSelection">Text
      selection and clipboard operations</a>).
    </li>

    <li>
      XML-compatible Web search engines will find text strings in
      SVG content with no additional effort over what they need to
      do to find text strings in other XML documents.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For accessibility reasons, it is recommended that text that is
    included in a document have appropriate semantic markup to
    indicate its function.
    For example,
    a text element that provides a visible label for part of a diagram
    should have an <a>'id'</a> that is referenced by
    an <a>'aria-labelledby'</a> attribute on the relevant group or path element.
    See <a href="access.html">SVG
    accessibility guidelines</a> for more information.

<h3 id="Definitions">Definitions</h3>

  <dl class="definitions">

    <dt><dfn id="TermCharacter" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">character</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A character is an atomic unit of text as defined in XML
      [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML</a>].
      <p class="note">
      Essentially, a Unicode code point.
	  A character may be a control instruction (such as a tab, carriage return, or line feed),
      a renderable mark (letter, digit, punctuation or other symbol),
      or a modifier (such as a combining accent).
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn id="TermAddressableCharacter" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">addressable character</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a>character</a> that is addressable by text positioning
      attributes and SVG DOM text methods.

      Characters discarded during layout such as
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#white-space-phase-1">collapsed
      white space characters</a> are not addressable, neither are characters
      within an element with a value of <span class='prop-value'>none</span> for
      the <a>'display'</a> property.

      Addressable characters are addressed by their index. Indexes are
      determined prior to applying any <a>'text-transform'</a>
      conversions, as described for the methods in the
      <a>SVGTextContentElement</a> interface.

      There are two methods to map an index to a character; the choice of
      which to use depends on purpose:

      <ol>
        <li>
          For the purposes of mapping text positioning attributes, the
          index is measured in Unicode code points (thus a 'u'
          followed by the combining diaeresis ' ̈' is counted as two
          characters while the precomposed character 'ü' is counted as
          one character).
        </li>
        <li>
          For the purposes of SVG DOM text methods, the index is
          measured in UTF-16 code units (thus, a single Unicode code
          point above U+FFFF will map to two addressable characters as
          a UTF-16 code unit consists of 16 bits).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">
        The different methods are backwards compatible with SVG
        1.1. The use of UTF-16 code units for SVG DOM text methods is
        required from the definition of DOMString in the DOM 2
        specification.
      </p>

      <p class="annotation">
        The SVG working group is interested in implementer feedback on
        the possibility of using grapheme clusters as defined by the
        Unicode Standard Annex #29 to replace Unicode code points in
        mapping text positioning attributes. Note, the use of the
        CSS <a>typographic character</a> is not appropriate as what
        constitutes a character can depend on context (line-breaking,
        word-breaking, etc.).
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If support for CSS generated-content text is introduced in the future,
        it would be included in the array of addressable characters.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn id="TermTypographicCharacterUnit">typographic character</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A unit of a writing system— such as a Latin alphabetic letter
      (including its diacritics), Hangul syllable, Chinese ideographic
      character, Myanmar syllable cluster— that is indivisible with
      respect to a particular typographic operation (line-breaking,
      first-letter effects, tracking, justification, vertical
      arrangement, etc.). For the normative definition and the
      relationship between this and a Unicode grapheme cluster, see

      A font represents an organized collection of <a>glyphs</a> in
      which the various glyph representations will share a particular
      appearance or styling.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn id="TermGlyph">glyph</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A glyph represents a unit of rendered content within a
      <a>font</a>. Often, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
      characters to be drawn and corresponding glyphs (e.g., usually
      the character "A" is rendered using a single glyph), but other
      times multiple glyphs are used to render a single character
      (e.g., characters with accents) or a single glyph can be used to render
      multiple characters (e.g., ligatures). Typically, a glyph is
      defined by one or more <a>shapes</a> such as
      a <a href="paths.html">path</a>, possibly with additional
      information such as rendering hints that help a font engine to
      produce legible text in small sizes.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn id="TermTextContentElement" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">text content element</dfn></dt>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn id="TermTextContentChildElement">text content child element</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A text content child element is a <a>text content element</a>

    <dt><dfn id="TermTextContentBlockElement">text content block element</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A text content block element is a <a>text content element</a>
      that serves as a standalone element for a unit of text, and
      which may optionally contain certain child <a>text content
      elements</a> (e.g.
      <a href="text.html#TextElement"><span class="element-name">'tspan'</span></a>).
      <!--SVG Tiny 1.2 defines two text content block elements:

  </dl>

<h3 id="FontsGlyphs">Fonts and glyphs</h3>

  <p>
    A font consists of a collection of glyphs together with other
    information (collectively, the font tables) necessary to use those
    glyphs to present characters on some visual medium. The
    combination of the collection of glyphs and the font tables is
    called the <em>font data</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A font may supply substitution and positioning tables that
    can be used by a formatter (text shaper) to re-order, combine and
    position a sequence of glyphs to form one or more composite
    glyphs. The combining may be as simple as a ligature, or as
    complex as an indic syllable which combines, usually with some
    re-ordering, multiple consonants and vowel glyphs. The tables may
    be language dependent, allowing the use of language appropriate
    letter forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a glyph, simple or composite, represents an indivisible unit
    for typesetting purposes, it is know as a <a>typographic
    character</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ligatures are an important feature of advance text layout. Some
    ligatures are discretionary while others (e.g. in Arabic) are
    required. The following explicit rules apply to ligature
    formation:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
      Ligature formation should not be enabled when characters are
      in different DOM text nodes;
      thus, characters separated by markup should not use ligatures.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Ligature formation should not be enabled when characters are
      in different <a>text chunks</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Discretionary ligatures should not be used when the spacing
      between two characters is not the same as the
      default space (e.g. when <a>'letter-spacing'</a> has a
      non-default value, or <a>'text-align'</a> has a value of
	  <span class="propvalue">justify</span>
      and <a>'text-justify'</a> has a value of <span class="propvalue">distribute</span>).
      (See
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#letter-spacing-property">CSS
	Text Module Level 3</a>,
      ([<a href="refs.html#ref-css-text-3">css-text-3</a>]).
      </p>
      <p>
      SVG attributes such as <a>'tspan/dx'</a>, <a>'textLength'</a>,
      and <a>'textPath/spacing'</a> (in <a>'textPath'</a>) that may
      reposition <a>typographic characters</a> do not break discretionary
      ligatures.
      If discretionary ligatures are not desired they can be turned
      off by using the <a>'font-variant-ligatures'</a> property.
      </p>
      <p>
      For OpenType fonts, discretionary ligatures include those enabled
      by the liga, clig, dlig, hlig, and cala features; required ligatures
      are found in the rlig feature.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Proper text rendering may depend on using the same font as used
    during authoring. For this reason SVG requires support for
    downloadable fonts as defined in the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#font-resources">Font
    Resources</a> section of the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/">CSS Fonts
    Module</a>. In particular, support for the Web Open Font Format
    [<a href="refs.html#ref-woff">WOFF</a>] is required.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    New in SVG 2, WOFF allows authors to provide the fonts needed to
    properly render their content. This includes ensuring that the
    fonts have the proper OpenType tables to support complex scripts,
    discretionary ligatures, swashes, old-style numbers, and so
    on. WOFF also allows the fonts to be compressed, subsetted, and
    include licensing information.
  </p>

<h3 id="GlyphsMetrics">Glyph metrics and layout</h3>

  <p>
    Glyph selection and positioning is normally handled according to
    the rules of CSS. In some cases, however, the final layout of text
    in SVG requires knowledge of the geometry properties of individual
    glyphs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The geometric font characteristics are expressed in a coordinate
    system based on the EM box. (The EM is a relative measure of the
    height of the glyphs in the font.)  The box 1 EM high and 1 EM
    wide is called the <em>design space</em>. This space is given a
    geometric coordinates by sub-dividing the EM into a number
    of <em>units per em</em>.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Units per em is a font characteristic. A typical value
    for units per em is 1000 or 2048.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coordinate space of the EM box is called the <em>design space
    coordinate system</em>. For scalable fonts, the curves and lines
    that are used to draw a glyph are represented using this
    coordinate system.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Most often, the (0,0) point in this coordinate system is
    positioned on the left edge of the EM box, but not at the bottom
    left corner. The Y coordinate of the bottom of a roman capital
    letter is usually zero. The descenders on lowercase roman
    letters have negative coordinate values.
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img class="bordered" src="images/text/font_embox.svg"
         alt="An 'M' inside an EM box showing the coordinate system, baseline,
	      ascent and descent."/>
    <p class="caption">
      An 'M' inside an Em box (blue square). The 'M' sits on the
      baseline (blue line). The origin of the coordinate system is
      shown by the small black circle.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    SVG assumes that the font tables will provide at least three font
    characteristics: an ascent, a descent and a set of
    baseline-tables. The ascent is the distance to the top of the EM
    box from the (0,0) point of the font; the descent is the distance
    to the bottom of the EM box from the (0.0) point of the font. The
    baseline-table is explained below.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Within an OpenType font ([<a href="refs.html#ref-opentype">OPENTYPE</a>]),
    for horizontal writing-modes,
    the ascent and descent are given by the sTypoAscender and
    sTypoDescender entries in the OS/2 table. For vertical writing-modes,
    the descent (the distance, in this case from the (0,0) point to the
    left edge of the glyph) is normally zero because the (0,0) point is on
    the left edge. The ascent for vertical writing-modes is either 1 em or
    is specified by the ideographic top baseline value in the OpenType
    Base table for vertical writing-modes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Glyphs are positioned relative to a particular point on each glyph
    known as the <a>alignment point</a>. For horizontal
    writing-modes, the glyphs' <a>alignment points</a> are vertically
    aligned while for vertical writing-modes, they are horizontally
    aligned. The position of the <a>alignment point</a> depends on the
    script. For example, Western glyphs are aligned at the bottom of
    capital letters, northern indic glyphs are aligned at the top
    of a horizontal stroke near the top of the glyphs, and far-eastern
    glyphs are aligned either at the bottom or center of the glyph.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within a script and within a line of text having a single
    font-size, the sequence of alignment points defines, in the
    <a>inline-base direction</a>, a geometric line called a
    <dfn id="TermBaseline" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">baseline</dfn>. Western and most other alphabetic and
    syllabic glyphs are aligned to an "alphabetic" baseline, the
    northern indic glyphs are aligned to a "hanging" baseline and the
    far-eastern glyphs are aligned to an "ideographic" baseline.
  </p>

      Example baselines (red lines) in three different scripts. From
      left to right: alphabetic, hanging, ideographic. The EM box is

    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    As glyphs are sequentially placed along a baseline, the
    <a>alignment point</a> of a glyph is typically positioned at the
    <a>current text position</a> (some properties such as
    <a>'vertical-align'</a> may alter the positioning). After each
    glyph is placed, the <a>current text position</a> is advanced by
    the glyph's <em>advance</em> value (typically the width for
    horizontal text or height for vertical text) with any correction
    for kerning or other spacing adjustment as well as for new lines
    in pre-formatted or auto-wrapped text. The initial and final
    current text positions are used for alignment (e.g. when
    the <a>'text-anchor'</a> value is either 'middle' or 'end'). The
    glyph's advance is needed when placing text along a path.
  </p>

      Example of font metrics. The blue boxes show the geometric
      boxes for the three glyphs. The labeled small circles show the
      <a>current text position</a> before glyph placement. The
      small square shows the final <a>current text position</a>
      after placing the last glyph. Note that the left side of
      the 'a' glyph's box is not aligned with the right side of
      the 'V' glyph's box due to kerning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    If a glyph does not provide explicit advance values corresponding
    to the current glyph orientation, then an appropriate
    approximation should be used. For vertical text, a suggested
    approximation is the <em>em</em> size.
  </p>

  <p>
    The initial <a>current text position</a> is established by the
    <a>'text/x'</a> and <a>'text/y'</a> attributes on the
    <a>'text'</a> element or first rendered <a>'tspan'</a> element for
    pre-formatted text, or auto-wrapped text when the <a>content
    area</a> is determined by the <a>'inline-size'</a> property. For
    other auto-wrapped text, the initial <a>current text position</a>
    is determined by the position of the first rendered glyph after
    applying the CSS line wrapping algorithm.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <dfn id="TermBaselineTable" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">baseline-table</dfn> specifies the position of one or more
    baselines in the design space coordinate system. The function of
    the baseline table is to facilitate the alignment of different
    scripts with respect to each other when they are mixed on the same
    text line. Because the desired relative alignments may depend on
    which script is dominant in a line (or block), there may be a
    different baseline table for each script. In addition, different
    alignment positions are needed for horizontal and vertical writing
    modes. Therefore, the font may have a set of baseline tables:
    typically, one or more for horizontal writing-modes and zero or
    more for vertical writing-modes.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Some fonts may not have values for the baseline tables. Heuristics
    are suggested for approximating the baseline tables in
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#baseline-synthesis-fonts">CSS
      Inline Layout Module Level 3</a> [css-inline-3]
    when a given font does not supply baseline tables.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a different font (or change in font size) is specified in the
    middle of a run of text, the <dfn id="TermDominantBaseline" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">dominant baseline</dfn>
    determines the baseline used to align glyphs in the new font (new
    size) to those in the previous font. The
    <a>'dominant-baseline'</a> property is used to set the dominant
    baseline.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alignment between an object relative to its parent is determined
    by the <dfn id="TermAlignmentBaseline" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">alignment baseline</dfn>. It is normally the same
    baseline as the dominant baseline but by using the shorthand
    <a>'vertical-align'</a> property (preferred) or the longhand
    <a>'alignment-baseline'</a> another baseline can be chosen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dominant baseline can be temporarily shifted (as needed
    for superscripts or subscripts) by using either the shorthand
    <a>'vertical-align'</a> property (preferred) or the longhand
    <a>'baseline-shift'</a> property. Note that shifts can be
    nested, each shift added to the previous shift.

  <p>
    SVG further assumes that for each glyph in the font data for a
    font, there are two width values, two alignment-baselines and two
    alignment points, one each for horizontal writing-modes and the
    other for vertical writing-modes. (Even though it is specified as
    a width, for vertical writing-modes the width is used in the
    vertical direction.) The <a>inline-base direction</a>
    position of the alignment point is on the start-edge of the glyph.

    A single line of text is laid out inside a <a>line box</a>.
    Multi-line text is produced by stacking these boxes. The height of
    a <a>line box</a> is determined by finding the maximum ascent and
    the maximum descent of all the glyphs in a line of text after
    applying the effect of the <a>'line-height'</a> property.  The
    width of a <a>line box</a> is normally the width of the containing
    text block. In SVG, when the containing text block does not have a
    fixed geometry (as with pre-formatted text), the <a>line box</a>
    tightly wraps the glyph boxes within the box.
  </p>

    <p class="caption">
      Example of determining the height of a <a>line box</a>.

      First each glyph box (small light-blue boxes) is extended
      vertically above and below according to the <a>'line-height'</a>
      property. In this case the <a>'line-height'</a> property is
      125%. The larger glyphs have a <a>'font-size'</a> of 96px so
      their extra height is 24px (25% of 96px). The extra height is
      evenly divided above and below resulting in the red boxes.  (For
      clarity, all glyphs in the same inline element have been grouped
      together).
      The final <a>line box</a> (large light-blue box) is then found
      using the maximum extents of the red boxes above and below the
      baseline.

  <p>
    In order to support various international writing systems, <a>line
    boxes</a> may be orientated in a horizontal or vertical direction.
    Text within a vertical <a>line box</a> flows from top to bottom.
    Text within a horizontal <a>line box</a> may flow left-to-right
    (e.g., modern Latin scripts), right-to-left (e.g., Hebrew or
    Arabic), or a mixture of left-to-right and right-to-left
    (bidirectional text).
  </p>

  <p>
    The processing model for bidirectional text is as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    The
    user agent processes the characters which are provided in
    <em>logical order</em> (i.e., the order the characters appear in
    the original document).
    </li>
    <li>
    The user agent excludes non-rendered elements
    and <a href="#WhiteSpace">collapses white space</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    The user agent determines
    the set of independent blocks within each of which it should apply
    the Unicode bidirectional algorithm.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each <a>text chunk</a> represents an independent block of text.
        </li>
        <li>
    Any change in glyph
    orientation due to processing of the
    <a>'text-orientation'</a> or obsoleted
    <a>'glyph-orientation-vertical'</a> properties
    will start a new independent
    blocks of text for bi-directional purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    After processing the Unicode bidirectional
    algorithm and properties <a>'direction'</a> and
    <a>'unicode-bidi'</a> on each of the independent text blocks, the
    user agent will have a potentially re-ordered list of characters
    which are now in left-to-right rendering order. Simultaneous with
    re-ordering of the characters, the <a>'tspan/dx'</a>,
    <a>'tspan/dy'</a>, and <a>'tspan/rotate'</a> attributes on the
    <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a> elements are also re-ordered to
    maintain the original correspondence between characters and
    attribute values.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While kerning or ligature processing might be
    font-specific, the preferred model is that kerning and ligature
    processing occurs between combinations of characters or glyphs
    after the characters have been re-ordered.
  </p>

  <p>
    The orientation of <a>line boxes</a> as well as the direction in
    which they are stacked (<a>block-flow direction</a>) is determined
    by the <a>'writing-mode'</a> property. For horizontal text
    (<a>'writing-mode'</a> value
    <span class="prop-value">horizontal-tb</span>) <a>line boxes</a>
    are stacked from top to bottom. For vertical text, <a>line boxes</a>
    are stacked from right-to-left (<a>'writing-mode'</a> value
    <span class="prop-value">vertical-rl</span>) or left-to-right
    (<a>'writing-mode'</a> value
    <span class="prop-value">vertical-lr</span>).
  </p>

<h2 id="TextElement">The <span class="element-name">'text'</span> and
  <span class="element-name">'tspan'</span> elements</h2>

  <p>
    The <a>'text'</a> element defines a graphics element consisting of
    text. The <a>'tspan'</a> element within a <a>'text'</a> or another
    <a>'tspan'</a> element, allows one to switch the style and/or
    adjust the position of the rendered text inside the <a>'tspan'</a>
    element relative to the parent element.
  </p>

  <p>
    The character data within the <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a>
    elements, along with relevant attributes and properties, and
    character-to-glyph mapping tables within the font itself, define
    the glyphs to be rendered. The attributes and properties on
    the <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a> elements indicate such things
    as the writing direction, font specification, and painting
    attributes which describe how exactly to render the
    characters. Subsequent sections of this chapter describe the
    relevant text-specific attributes and properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a> elements are rendered using
    the same rendering methods as other graphics elements, all of the
    same
    <a href="painting.html">painting</a> features that apply to
    <a>shapes</a> such as <a href="paths.html">paths</a> and
    <a href="shapes.html#RectElement">rectangles</a> also apply to
    <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a> elements,
    except for <a>markers</a>.
    In addition,
    <a href="coords.html">coordinate system transformations</a>,
    <a href="render.html#ClippingAndMasking">clipping</a>, and
    <a href="render.html#ClippingAndMasking">masking</a> can be applied
    to the <a>'text'</a> element as a whole.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    In CSS terms, the <a>'text'</a> element acts as a block
    element. The <a>'tspan'</a>, <a>'textPath'</a>, and <a>'a'</a>
    elements that are descended from <a>text content elements</a> act as
    inline elements.
  </p>

  <p id="ObjectBoundingBoxUnitsTextObjects">
    It is possible to apply a gradient, pattern, clipping path, mask
    or filter to text. When one of these facilities is applied to text
    and keyword <span class="attr-value">'objectBoundingBox'</span> is
    used (see
    <a href="coords.html#ObjectBoundingBox">Object bounding box
    units</a>) to specify a graphical effect relative to the "object
    bounding box", then the object bounding box units are computed
    relative to the entire <a>'text'</a> element in all cases, even
    when different effects are applied to different <a>'tspan'</a> or <a>'textPath'</a>
    elements within the same <a>'text'</a> element.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a>'text'</a> element renders its first glyph (after
    bidirectionality
    reordering) at the initial <a>current text position</a> (with
    possible adjustments due to the value of the
    <a>'text-anchor'</a> property or the <a>'text-align'</a> property).
    For pre-formatted text and for auto-wrapped text where the
    <a>content area</a> is determined by the <a>'inline-size'</a>
    property, the initial <a>current text
    position</a> is determined by the <a>'tspan/x'</a> and
    <a>'tspan/y'</a> values of the <a>'text'</a> or <a>'tspan'</a>
    element which contains the first rendered character.

    For auto-wrapped text in a shape or text on a path see
    the <a href="text.html#TextLayoutAuto">Auto-wrapped text</a> or
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutPath">Text on a path</a> sections,
    respectively, to determine the initial <a>current text
    position</a>.

    After the glyph(s) corresponding to the given character is (are)
    rendered, the current text position is updated for the next
    character. In the simplest case, the new current text position is
    the previous current text position plus the glyphs' advance value
    (horizontal or vertical). See
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutAlgorithm">text layout</a> for a description
    of glyph placement and glyph advance.

        adjustment ratio used for other content that shares the same

<h3 id="TSpanNotes">Notes on 'x', 'y', 'dx', 'dy' and 'rotate'</h3>

  <p>
    The <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, <a>'dy'</a>, and
    <a>'rotate'</a> on the <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a> elements
    are useful in
    high-end typography scenarios where individual glyphs require
    exact placement. These attributes are useful for minor positioning
    adjustments between characters or for major positioning
    adjustments, such as moving a section of text to a new location to
    achieve the visual effect of a new line of text (compatible with
    SVG 1.1). Note that the <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>,
    <a>'dy'</a>, and <a>'rotate'</a> attributes are
    ignored for auto-wrapped text (except for the initial <a>current
    text position</a> when the <a>content area</a> is specified by
    the <a>'inline-size'</a> property).
  </p>

  <p class="annotation" data-issue="2">
    It was decided at the 2015 Sydney F2F that 'dx', 'dy', and 'rotate'
    would be ignored for auto-wrapped text. (Technically, it is not
    difficult to apply them but it was not seen as being really useful.)
  </p>

  <p>
    In situations where micro-level positioning adjustment are
    necessary for advanced typographic control, the SVG content
    designer needs to ensure that the necessary font will be available
    for all viewers of the document (e.g., package up the necessary
    font data in the form of an SVG font or an alternative WebFont
    format which is stored at the same Web site as the SVG content)
    and that the viewing software will process the font in the
    expected way (the capabilities, characteristics and font layout
    mechanisms vary greatly from system to system). If the SVG content
    contains <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, or
    <a>'dy'</a> attribute values which are meant to correspond to a
    particular font processed by a particular set of viewing software
    and either of these requirements is not met, then the text might
    display with poor quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following additional rules apply to attributes <a>'x'</a>,
    <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, <a>'dy'</a>, and <a>'rotate'</a> when they
    contain a list of numbers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      When a single character maps to a single glyph – In this
      case, the <var>n</var>-th value for the
      <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, <a>'dy'</a>,
      and <a>'rotate'</a> attributes is applied to the glyph that
      corresponds to the <var>n</var>-th
      character.
    </li>

    <li>
      When a single character maps to multiple glyphs (e.g., when
      an accent glyph is placed on top of a base glyph) – In this
      case, the <var>n</var>-th value for
      the <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, and <a>'dy'</a> values
      are applied (i.e., the <a>current text position</a> is adjusted)
      before rendering the first glyph.  The rotation transformation
      corresponding to the
      <var>n</var>-th <a>'rotate'</a>
      value is applied to the glyphs and to the inter-glyph advance
      values corresponding to this character on a group basis (i.e.,
      the rotation value creates a temporary new rotated coordinate
      system, and the glyphs corresponding to the character are
      rendered into this rotated coordinate system).
    </li>

    <li>
      When multiple characters map to a single glyph (e.g., when a
      ligature is used) – Suppose that the
      <var>n</var>-th and
      (<var>n</var>+1)-th characters
      map to a single glyph. In this case, the
      <var>n</var>-th value for the
      <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, <a>'dy'</a>,
      and <a>'rotate'</a> attributes all apply when rendering the
      glyph. The (<var>n</var>+1)-th values,
      however, for <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, and <a>'rotate'</a> are
      ignored (exception: the final <a>'rotate'</a> value in the list
      would still apply to subsequent characters), whereas
      the <a>'dx'</a> and <a>'dy'</a> are applied to the subsequent
      character (i.e., the
      (<var>n</var>+2)-th character), if one
      exists, by translating the <a>current text position</a> by the
      given amounts before rendering the first glyph associated with
      that character.
    </li>

    <li>
      When there is a many-to-many mapping of characters to
      glyphs (e.g., when three characters map to two glyphs, such as
      when the first glyph expresses the first character and half
      of the second character, and the second glyph expresses the
      other half of the second character plus the third character)
      – Suppose that the <var>n</var>-th,
      (<var>n</var>+1)-th and
      (<var>n</var>+2)-th characters map
      to two glyphs. In this case, the
      <var>n</var>-th value for the
      <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, <a>'dx'</a>, and <a>'dy'</a> values
      are applied (i.e., the <a >current text position</a> is
      adjusted) before rendering the first glyph.  The rotation
      transformation corresponding to the
      <var>n</var>-th <a>'rotate'</a>
      value is applied to both the two glyphs and the glyph advance
      values for the first glyph on a group basis (i.e., the rotation
      value creates a temporary new rotated coordinate system, and the
      two glyphs are rendered into the temporary rotated coordinate
      system). The (<var>n</var>+1)-th and
      (<var>n</var>+2)-th values, however, for
      the <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>, and <a>'rotate'</a> attributes are
      not applied (exception: the final <a>'rotate'</a> value in the
      list would still apply to subsequent characters), whereas
      the (<var>n</var>+1)-th
      and (<var>n</var>+2)-th values for
      the <a>'dx'</a> and <a>'dy'</a> attributes are applied to the
      subsequent character (i.e.,
      the (<var>n</var>+3)-th character), if
      one exists, by translating the <a >current text position</a> by
      the given amounts before rendering the first glyph associated
      with that character.
    </li>

    <li>
      Relationship to bidirectionality –
      Text is laid out in a two-step process, where any bidirectional
      text is first re-ordered into a left-to-right string, and then
      text layout occurs with the re-ordered text string. Whenever the
      character data within a <a>'tspan'</a> element is re-ordered,
      the corresponding elements within the <a>'x'</a>, <a>'y'</a>,
      <a>'dx'</a>, <a>'dy'</a>, and <a>'rotate'</a> are also
      re-ordered to maintain the correspondence. For example,
      suppose that there is the following <a>'tspan'</a> element:
      <div style="margin-left: 2em"><code>&lt;tspan dx="11 12 13 14 15 0 21 22 23 0 31 32 33 34 35 36"&gt;Latin and Hebrew&lt;/tspan&gt;</code></div>
      and that the word "Hebrew" will be drawn right-to-left. First,
      the character data and the corresponding values in
      the <a>'dx'</a> list will be reordered, such that the text
      string will be "Latin and werbeH" and the list of values for
      the <a>'dx'</a> attribute will be "11 12 13 14 15 0 21 22 23 0
      36 35 34 33 32 31". After this re-ordering, the glyphs
      corresponding to the characters will be positioned using
      standard left-to-right layout rules.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span class="example-ref">Example tspan04</span> uses the
    <a>'rotate'</a> attribute on the <a>'tspan'</a> element to rotate the
    glyphs to be rendered. This example shows a single text string in a
    <a>'tspan'</a> element that contains more characters than the
    number of values specified in the <a>'rotate'</a> attribute. In
    this case the last value specified in the <a>'rotate'</a>
    attribute of the <a>'tspan'</a> must be applied to the remaining
    characters in the string.

    Rotation of red text inside the <a>'text'</a> element:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The <a>'rotate'</a> value will rotate the characters in the text
      <em>"Not "</em> by 5, 15, 25 and 35 degrees respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <a>'rotate'</a> value is applied to the space that follows the

      before the text <em>"rotation"</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The next current <a>'rotate'</a> value specified is 45 followed
      by 55. The current <a>'rotate'</a> value in the <a>'text'</a>
      element is incremented as subsequent characters in the text of the
      child <a>'tspan'</a> elements are processed.
    </li>
    <li>
      The next immediate <a>'tspan'</a> element specifies rotate values
      for the text, hence the current <a>'rotate'</a> value will change to
      the next value in the list (but is not used) as each character is
      processed until the last value of 55 degrees is reached.
    </li>
    <li>
      The last <a>'rotate'</a> value of 55 degrees will be applied to all
      the characters in the text <em>"rotation"</em>.

    Rotation of the orange text inside the "child1" <a>'tspan'</a>element:

      The <a>'rotate'</a> value will rotate the first 4 characters in the
      text <em>"all characters "</em> by -10, -20, -30 and -40
      respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      The last <a>'rotate'</a> value of -40 becomes the current
      <a>'rotate'</a> value and will be applied to all subsequent
      characters in the <a>'tspan'</a> element and to any child
      <a>'tspan'</a> elements that do not specify <a>'rotate'</a>
      values.
    </li>

      in the text <em>"text"</em> specified within the "child4"
      <a>'tspan'</a> element will be rotated by -40 degrees.

  <p>
    This section gives a short overview of SVG text layout. It is
    followed by sections that cover different aspects of text layout
    in more detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    Text layout in SVG is a multi-stage process that takes as input
    a <a>'text'</a> element subtree and its property values and
    produces a sequence of glyphs to render and their positions in
    each <a>text content element</a>'s coordinate system.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, a <a>'text'</a> element and its descendants are laid out
    inside a <a>content area</a> or <a>wrapping area</a> according to
    CSS, as if the <a>'text'</a> were a block element and any
    <a>'tspan'</a>, <a>'textPath'</a>, and <a>'a'</a> descendants were
    inline elements. This layout takes into account all paragraph
    level and font related CSS properties described in this chapter.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a>content area</a> may be explicitly declared by setting the
    <a>'inline-size'</a> property, or by setting
    the <a>'shape-inside'</a> property that defines or references an
    SVG <a>shape</a>. If a <a>content area</a> is not declared, it
    defaults to a rectangle of infinite width and height.
  </p>

  <p>
    Second, any positioning given by <a>'tspan/x'</a>, <a>'tspan/y'</a>,
    <a>'tspan/dx'</a> and <a>'tspan/dy'</a> attributes are applied to
    the resulting glyph positions from the CSS layout process.

    The rules for which transforms are allowed depend on if
    the <a>content area</a> was explicitly declared or not. If not
    explicitly declared, the rules define the layout of
    <em>pre-formatted</em> text. If declared, the rules define the
    layout of <em>auto-wrapped</em> text.
  </p>

  <p>
    Third, the effect of the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property is applied
    if necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, layout of glyphs for any <a>'textPath'</a> elements is
    performed, converting <em>pre-formatted</em> text
    to <em>text-on-a-path</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples of the different types of text layout:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Pre-formatted:</dt>
    <dd>For short strings of text (e.g. labels) or where exact
      placement of glyphs is required (e.g. hand-kerned titles).

  <p class="note">
    SVG 2 introduces the ability to automatically wrap text inside a
    rectangle or other shape by specifying a <a>content area</a>. The
    design of SVG wrapped text is motivated by the desire that SVG
    text wrapping be as compatible as possible with text wrapping in
    CSS in order that renderers that support CSS text wrapping can
    implement SVG text wrapping easily (but without requiring non-HTML
    compatible SVG renderers to implement HTML). There are several
    differences between SVG and CSS text wrapping. The most important
    is that in SVG, a <a>content area</a> must be explicitly provided
    as SVG does not have an automatic finite (or semi-finite)
    <a>content area</a> (provided in CSS by the box model). Another
    difference is that SVG does not have the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; and
    &lt;br/&gt; elements which create line breaks. Instead, SVG relies
    on the <span class="prop-value">pre</span> and
    <span class="prop-value">pre-line</span> values of
    <a>'white-space'</a> to provide line breaks. SVG wrapped text also
    allows a content-creation tool to provide a natural fallback for
    SVG 1.1 renderers that do not support wrapped text (by use of
    <a>'text/x'</a> and <a>'text/y'</a> attributes in the <a>'text'</a> and
    <a>'tspan'</a> elements, which are ignored by SVG 2 renderers for
    auto-wrapped text).
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    SVG's text layout options are designed to cover most general use
    cases. If more complex layout is required (bulleted lists, tables,
    etc.), text can be rendered in another XML namespace such as XHTML
    [<a href="refs.html#ref-html">HTML</a>] embedded inline within a
    <a>'foreignObject'</a> element.
  </p>

<h2 id="TextLayoutContentArea">Text layout – Content Area</h2>

  <p>
    A <dfn>content area</dfn> is defined by specifying in
    a <a>'text'</a> element an <a>'inline-size'</a> property,
    or a <a>'shape-inside'</a> property that defines
    or references an SVG <a>shape</a>. If no <a>content area</a> is
    provided, the <a>content area</a> defaults to a rectangle of
    infinite width and height (see the
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutPre">pre-formatted text</a> section).
    If both an <a>'inline-size'</a> property and a
    <a>'shape-inside'</a> property with value other than 'none' are
    given, the <a>'shape-inside'</a> property is used.
  </p>

  <p id="TextLayoutWrappingArea">
    Wrapped text is laid out in a <dfn>wrapping area</dfn>. The
    <a>wrapping area</a> is normally the same as the <a>content
    area</a>. When the <a>content area</a> is defined using
    the <a>'shape-inside'</a> property, the <a>wrapping area</a>
    may be smaller due to the presence of a <a>'shape-subtract'</a>
    property and/or a <a>'shape-padding'</a> property. The
    <a>'shape-subtract'</a> property (along with the
    <a>'shape-margin'</a> property) defines a <dfn>wrapping
    context</dfn>. The <a>wrapping area</a> is found by
    insetting the <a>content area</a> by the <a>'shape-padding'</a> distance,
    and then subtracting the <a>wrapping context</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a <a>wrapping area</a> is defined, the text is laid out
    inside the <a>wrapping area</a> according to the rules of CSS
    (respecting any special rules given in this section).

  </p>

  <p>
    The <a>'inline-size'</a> property allows one to set the
    <a>wrapping area</a> to a rectangular shape. The computed value of
    the property sets the width of the rectangle for horizontal text
    and the height of the rectangle for vertical text. The other
    dimension (height for horizontal text, width for vertical text) is
    of infinite length. A value of zero disables the creation of a
    <a>wrapping area</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The initial <a>current text position</a> is taken from the
    <a>'text/x'</a> and <a>'text/y'</a> attributes of the
    <a>'text'</a> element (or first child <a>'tspan'</a> element
    if the attributes are not given on the <a>'text'</a> element).

    For left-to-right text, the initial <a>current text position</a>
    is at the left of the rectangle. For right-to-left text it is at
    the right of the rectangle.

    For vertical text, the initial <a>current text position</a> is at
    the top of the rectangle.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rectangle (<a>wrapping area</a>) is then anchored according to
    the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property using the edges of the
    <a>wrapping area</a> to determine the start, middle, and end
    positions.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The <a>'inline-size'</a> property method to wrap text is an
    extension to pre-formatted SVG text where the author simply gives
    a limit to the width or height of the block of text; thus the use
    of the <a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a> attributes along with
    the <a>'direction'</a> and <a>'text-anchor'</a> properties to
    position the first line of text. If full justification is needed,
    the <a>'shape-inside'</a> property should be used to create

    SVG allows the <a>'shape-inside'</a> property to have a list of
    shapes. Each shape defines an independent <a>content area</a>.
    Text is first laid out in the content area of the first shape. If
    the text overflows the first shape, the overflow text is laid out
    in the next shape until all text is laid out or no more shapes are
    available.

  <p class="note">
    The effect is similar to CSS columns,

    It is recommended that an <q>overflow</q> shape be provided to

<h2 id="TextLayoutAlgorithm">Text layout – Algorithm</h2>

<div class='ready-for-wider-review'>

  <p>
    Text layout begins by passing to a CSS-based text renderer the
    content of the <a>'text'</a> element which includes text data
    along with styling information and a description of one or more
    shapes to be filled. The <a>'text'</a> element is treated as a
    block element and its descendant <a>'tspan'</a>, <a>'textPath'</a>
    and <a>'a'</a> elements are treated as inline elements. The CSS
    renderer returns a set of <a>typographic characters</a> with
    their positions resulting from laying out the text as if the text
    were absolutely positioned.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    A <a>typographic character</a> may contain more than
    one <a>glyph</a>. It is assumed here the relative positioning of
    the <a>glyphs</a> inside a <a>typographic character</a> is
    encapsulated by the <a>typographic character</a> and it is
    not user controllable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a <a>content area</a> has been defined, the following
    algorithm is used to determine the <a>typographic characters</a>
    and their positions for a given <a>'text'</a> element:
  </p>

  <ul class='algorithm'>
    <li>
      For text where the <a>content area</a> is defined by the
      <a>'shape-inside'</a> property, layout the text in one or more
      areas per CSS rules for laying out text in a CSS <a>wrapping
      area</a>.

      <p class="note">
	SVG allows the <a>'shape-inside'</a> property to reference
	more than one shape. Each shape should be filled in turn until
	there is no more text or no more shapes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      For text where the <a>content area</a> is defined by the
      <a>'inline-size'</a> property, layout the text in a CSS content
      box where the <a>inline size</a> is set to the value of
      the <a>'inline-size'</a> property and the <a>block size</a> is
      unconstrained.

      <p class='note'>
       This means that text is laid out with the box width set to
       the <a>'inline-size'</a> value if <a>'writing-mode'</a>
       is <span class='prop-value'>horizontal-tb</span>, or with the
       box height set to the <a>'inline-size'</a> value otherwise.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      For all other text (SVG 1.1 compatible text and SVG 1.1
      like multi-line text), layout the text in a CSS content box that
      is unconstrained in width and height.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A number of CSS properties have no or limited effect on SVG text
    layout:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The used value of each of the following properties on a <a>text
      content element</a> (and its pseudo-elements, if any) and on
      an <a>'a'</a> element within a <a>text content block element</a>
      must be the property's initial values:
      <span class='property'>'border-style'</span>,
      <span class='property'>'float'</span>,
      <span class='property'>'margin'</span>,
      <span class='property'>'padding'</span>,
      <span class='property'>'position'</span> and
      <span class='property'>'text-align'</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      If the computed value of the <a>'display'</a> property on a
      correctly parented <a>text content block element</a> is anything
      other than
      <span class='prop-value'>none</span>, then its used value must
      be
      <span class='prop-value'>block</span>.

      <p class='note'>
	This ensures that the <a>'text'</a> element is treated as if
	it were a block element.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      If the computed value of the <a>'display'</a> property on a
      correctly parented <a>text content child element</a>
      or <a>'a'</a> element,
      is anything other than
      <span class='prop-value'>none</span>, then its used value must
      be
      <span class='prop-value'>inline</span>.

      <p class='note'>
	This ensures that <a>'tspan'</a>, <a>'textPath'</a> and
	<a>'a'</a> elements are treated as if they were inline elements.
	Note: the <a>'transform'</a> property has no effect on
	inline elements.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      The used value of the <a>'display'</a> property on an element
      that is a descendant of a <a>text content block element</a> and
      is not a correctly parented <a>text content child element</a>
      or <a>'a'</a> element must be
      <span class='prop-value'>none</span>.

      <p class='note'>
	This ensures that graphics and metadata elements inside a <a>'text'</a>
	element do not render.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Various SVG attributes and properties may reposition the
    <a>typographic characters</a> depending on how the <a>content
    area</a> is defined:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      For text where the <a>content area</a> is defined by the
      <a>'shape-inside'</a> property, the <a>typographic
      characters</a> are rendered with positions as returned from the
      CSS-based text renderer.
    </li>
    <li>
      For text where the <a>content area</a> is defined by the
      <a>'inline-size'</a> property, each <a>line box</a> is
      shifted according to the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property.
      No further post-processing is performed.
    </li>
    <li>
      For all other text (SVG 1.1 compatible text and SVG 1.1 like
      multi-line text), the positions of the <a>typographic
      characters</a> are adjusted according to the algorithm that
      follows.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The following SVG text layout algorithm returns output information
    about each character in the DOM in the <a>'text'</a> element's
    subtree. That information includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      a global index number, which indicates the index of the
      character relative to the start of the <a>'text'</a> element;
    </li>
    <li>
      an (x, y) coordinate pair, which gives its position in the
      coordinate space of the <a>'text'</a> element;
    </li>
    <li>
      an angle value, which gives its rotation;
    </li>
    <li>
      a "hidden" flag, which represents whether it is hidden due to
      falling off the end of a <a>'textPath'</a>;
    </li>
    <li>
      an "addressable" flag, which represents whether it is
      an <a>addressable character</a>, that is, addressable by text
      positioning attributes and SVG DOM text methods;
    </li>
    <li>
      a "middle" flag, which represents whether it is the second or
      later character of a <a>typographic character</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      an "anchored chunk" flag, which represents whether it starts a
      contiguous sequence of glyphs that can be affected by text
      anchoring

    corresponds to more than one character (e.g. a ligature), only
    the array values corresponding to the first character are used

    are skipped (for <a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a>), are
    accumulated and applied to the next <a>typographic character</a>

<h2 id="TextLayoutPre">Pre-formatted text</h2>

  <p class="note">
    This option corresponds to basic SVG 1.1 text layout.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the default text layout method and is used in the absence
    of an explicitly defined <a>content area</a>. It is also used as a
    first step in laying out <em>text on a path</em> (with slightly
    modified rules). In this layout method, no automatic line breaking
    or word wrapping is done. Nominally, the text is rendered as a
    single line inside a rectangular <a>content area</a> of infinite
    width and height. Multiple lines of text can be obtained by
    precomputing line breaks and using one of the following methods:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Use a single <a>'text'</a> element with <a>'white-space'</a> set
      to <span class="prop-value">pre</span>
      or <span class="prop-value">pre-line</span>. Line spacing is set
      by <a>'line-height'</a>.

      <p class="note">New in SVG 2.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Use a single <a>'text'</a> element with one or more <a>'tspan'</a>
      child elements with appropriate values for attributes
      <a>'tspan/x'</a>, <a>'tspan/y'</a>,
      <a>'tspan/dx'</a> and <a>'tspan/dy'</a> to set new start positions
      for those characters which start new lines.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use multiple <a>'text'</a> elements, one for each line of
      text. (Not recommended as this may prevent selection across multiple
      lines of text -- see
      <a href="text.html#TextSelection">Text selection and clipboard
        operations</a>.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    The following properties do not apply to <em>pre-formatted</em> text:
    <a>'text-align'</a>, <a>'text-align-last'</a>, <a>'line-break'</a>,
    <a>'word-break'</a>, <a>'hyphens'</a>, <a>'word-wrap'</a>,
    and <a>'overflow-wrap'</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="TextLayoutPreMultiline">Multi-line text via 'white-space'</h3>

  <p>
    Multi-line pre-formatted text may be created by using the
    <a>'white-space'</a> values <span class="prop-value">pre</span>
    or <span class="prop-value">pre-line</span>. In these cases, a
    line-feed or carriage return is preserved as a forced line
    break which creates a new <a>line box</a>. The <a>line
    boxes</a> are stacked following the rules of CSS.
  </p>

<h3 id="TextLayoutPreAdjustments">Repositioning Glyphs</h3>

  <p>
    After text is laid out according to the basic CSS text layout
    rules, <a>typographic characters</a> can be repositioned using SVG
    specific rules.  Absolute repositioning can be prescribed by
    giving absolute coordinates in the <a>'tspan/x'</a>
    and <a>'tspan/y'</a> attributes or by forced line breaks. Absolute
    repositioning may be influenced by the <a>'text-anchor'</a>
    property. Relative repositioning can be prescribed by giving
    relative coordinates in the <a>'tspan/dx'</a>
    and <a>'tspan/dy'</a> attributes. The
    <a>typographic characters</a> may be arbitrarily rotated by giving
    a list of values in the <a>'tspan/rotate'</a> attribute. Absolute
    repositioning (including any adjustment due to
    the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property) is done before relative
    repositioning and rotation.
  </p>

<h2 id="TextLayoutAuto">Auto-wrapped text</h2>

  <p>
    Text is automatically wrapped when a <a>content area</a> is
    specified in the <a>'text'</a> element. The <a>content area</a>
    defines the outermost container for wrapping text. A <a>wrapping
    context</a> (set of exclusion areas) may also be given. The
    actual <a>wrapping area</a> is defined by subtracting the
    <a>wrapping context</a> from the <a>content area</a>. The
    <a>wrapping context</a> may also be reduced by the value of the
    <a>'shape-padding'</a> property. The effective area of an
    exclusion may be enlarged by the value of the
    <a>'shape-margin'</a> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the case where the <a>content area</a> is defined by
    the <a>'inline-size'</a> property,
    the <a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a> attributes
    corresponding to the first rendered
    <a>typographic character</a> define the initial <a>current
    text position</a>. When the <a>content area</a> is inside
    a <a>shape</a>, the initial <a>current text position</a> is
    determined from the position of the first rendered <a>typographic
    character</a> after laying out the first line box inside the
    shape.
  </p>

  <p>
    Except when used to determine the initial <a>current text
    position</a>, all values <a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a>
    are ignored on <a>'text'</a>, and <a>'tspan'</a>
    elements in auto-wrapped text.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The attributes <a>'text/x'</a> and <a>'text/y'</a> can provide a
    natural fallback mechanism for SVG1.1 renderers for wrapped text.
    Content producers may wish to pre-layout text by breaking up
    lines into <a>'tspan'</a> elements with <a>'text/x'</a> and
    <a>'text/y'</a> attributes. Then, for example, if a fallback font
    is used to render the text, an SVG2 renderer will ignore
    the <a>'text/x'</a> and <a>'text/y'</a> attributes and reflow the
    text using the font metrics of the fallback font. An SVG1.1
    renderer will use the <a>'text/x'</a> and <a>'text/y'</a>
    attributes in rendering the text which will usually result in
    readable text even if the rendering doesn't match the shape.

    Many of the text wrapping examples in this section rely on this
    mechanism to render text in browsers that have not implemented
    text wrapping.

<h3 id="TextLayoutAutoNotes">Notes on Text Wrapping</h3>

  <p>
    The following examples illustrate a few issues with laying out
    text in a shape.
  </p>

<h4 id="TextLayoutAutoNotesStart">First Line Positioning</h4>

  <p>
    Given an arbitrary shaped <a>wrapping area</a>, the first
    <a>line box</a> may not fit flush against the top (or side for
    vertical text). In this case, the first <a>line box</a> is shifted
    until it fits.
  </p>
  <p class="annotation">
    In CSS, the edge of a shape is treated as a series of 1 pixel × 1
    pixel floats.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    A future CSS specification may define a line grid that could be used
    to control the position of the first line of text to allow alignment
    of text between different <a>wrapping areas</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img class="bordered" src="images/text/text-layout-firstline.svg"
         alt="Image showing two lines of text, the first line is 'The' and
              the next line is 'first line'."/>
    <p class="caption">
      The top <a>line box</a> (small light-blue rectangle), consisting
      of the smallest possible block of text, is moved down until the
      <a>line box</a> fits inside the <a>wrapping area</a> (light-blue
      path). Note, the <a>line box</a> includes the effect of
      the <a>'line-height'</a> property, here set to 1.25. The red
      rectangles tightly wrap the glyphs in each <a>line box</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="annotation">
    This appears to be different from the SVG 1.2 draft in which the
    top of the wrapping area served as the origin of a line grid.
    The first line was moved down by the line height until it fit
    inside the shape.
  </p>

<h4 id="TextLayoutAutoNotesBrokenLines">Broken Lines</h4>

  <p>
    Given an arbitrary shaped <a>wrapping area</a>, a single line of
    text might be broken into more than one part. In this case,
    a <a>line box</a> for each part is created. The height of
    all <a>line boxes</a> in a single line of text must be the same
    (ensuring all parts have the same baseline). This height is
    calculated by looking at all glyphs in the line of text.
  </p>
  <p class="annotation">
    This default behavior was agreed to at the CSS/SVG joint working
    group meeting in Sydney 2016.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    A future CSS specification may allow one to control which parts of
    a shape broken into different parts is filled (e.g, fill only the
    right most parts, fill only the left most parts, etc.).
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img class="bordered" src="images/text/text-layout-brokenline.svg"
         alt="Image showing text laidout inside a 'V' shape."/>
    <p class="caption">
      The top line is split into two <a>line boxes</a> (light-blue
      rectangles), text in each <a>line box</a> is centered inside the
      box (due to 'text-align:center').
    </p>
  </div>

<h2 id="TextLayoutPath">Text on a path</h2>

<edit:with element='textPath'>

  <p>
    SVG can place text along a path defined either by a <a>'path element'</a>
    element or the path equivalent of a <a>basic shape</a>. This is
    specified by including text within a <a>'textPath'</a> element
    that has either an <a>'href'</a> attribute with an <a>URL
    reference</a> pointing to a <a>'path element'</a> element or <a>basic
    shape</a>, or by specifying a value for the <a>'path'</a> attribute that
    specifies the path data directly.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The ability to place text along a basic shape is new in SVG 2.
  </p>

  <p class="annotation">
    Placing text along a basic shape was resolved at the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/02/12-svg-minutes.html#item05">Sydney
    (2015)</a> meeting.
  </p>

  <p class="annotation">
    Directly using a 'd' attribute to specify the path was added to
    SVG 2. The 'd' attribute was renamed to 'path' by decision at the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/21-svg-minutes.html">London
      (2016)</a> editor's meeting at the same time 'd' was promoted
    to being a presentation attribute.
  </p>

  <p>
    Text on a path is conceptionally like a single line of
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutPre">pre-formatted text</a> that
    is then transformed to follow the path. Except as indicated, all
    the properties that apply to pre-formatted text apply to text on a
    path.

        Typically, supplemental rotation, scaling and

    the <a>'text'</a> and the use of the <a>'path element'</a> element as the
    referenced shape for text on a path. Further note that
    the <code style="font-weight:bold; color: green">transform="scale(2)"</code>
    scales the path (equivalent to multiplying every coordinate by 2 for simple linear paths),
    but does not scale the text placed along the path.

<h3 id="TextpathLayoutRules">Text on a path layout rules</h3>

  <p>
    Conceptually, for text on a path the target path is stretched out
    into either a horizontal or vertical straight line segment. For
    horizontal text layout flows, the path is stretched out into a
    hypothetical horizontal line segment such that the start of the
    path is mapped to the left of the line segment. For vertical text
    layout flows, the path is stretched out into a hypothetical
    vertical line segment such that the start of the path is mapped to
    the top of the line segment. The standard
    <a href="text.html#TextLayoutAlgorithm">text layout</a> rules are
    applied to the hypothetical straight line segment and the result
    is mapped back onto the target path. Vertical and
    bidirectional <a href="text.html#TextLayoutAlgorithm">text layout</a> rules
    also apply to text on a path.
  </p>
  <p>
    The orientation of each glyph along a path is determined individually.
    For horizontal text layout flows, the default orientation (the <q>up</q>
    direction) for a given glyph is along the vector that starts
    at the intersection point on the path to which the glyph is
    attached and which points in the direction 90 degrees
    counter-clockwise from the angle of the curve at the intersection
    point. For vertical text layout flows, the default orientation
    for a given glyph is along the vector that starts at the intersection
    point on the path to which the glyph is attached and which points
    in the direction 180 degrees from the angle of the curve at the
    intersection point.

    The following picture does an initial zoom in on the first glyph

  <p>
    The small dot above shows the point at which the glyph is attached
    to the path. The box around the glyph shows the glyph is rotated
    such that its horizontal axis is parallel to the tangent of the
    curve at the point at which the glyph is attached to the path. The
    box also shows the glyph's <dfn id="CharWidth" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">charwidth</dfn>
    (i.e., the amount which the current text position advances
    horizontally when the glyph is drawn using horizontal text
    layout).
  </p>

  <p>
    The next picture zooms in further to demonstrate the detailed
    layout rules.
  </p>

  <img alt="Image that shows text on a path"
       src="images/text/toap06.png" width="288" height="176" />

  <p>
    For left-to-right horizontal text layout along a path (i.e.,
    when the glyph orientation is perpendicular to the
    <a>inline-base direction</a> the layout rules are as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Determine the
      <dfn id="StartPointOnPath" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">startpoint-on-the-path</dfn> for the
      first glyph using attribute <a>'startOffset'</a> and property
      <a>'text-anchor'</a>. For <span class='prop-value'>text-anchor:start</span>,
      startpoint-on-the-path is the point on the path which represents
      the point on the path which is <a>'startOffset'</a> distance
      along the path from the start of the path, calculated using the
      user agent's <a href="paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance
      along the path</a> algorithm.

      For <span class="prop-value">text-anchor:middle</span>,
      startpoint-on-the-path is the point on the path which represents
      the point on the path which is [ <a>'startOffset'</a> minus half
      of the total advance values for all of the glyphs in
      the <a>'textPath'</a> element ] distance along the path from the
      start of the path, calculated using the user
      agent's <a href="paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance along
      the path</a> algorithm.

      For <span class="prop-value">text-anchor:end</span>,
      startpoint-on-the-path is the point on the path which represents
      the point on the path which is [ <a>'startOffset'</a> minus the
      total advance values for all of the glyphs in
      the <a>'textPath'</a> element ]. Before rendering the first
      glyph, the horizontal component of the startpoint-on-the-path is
      adjusted to take into account various horizontal alignment text
      properties and attributes, such as a <a>'tspan/dx'</a> attribute
      value on a <a>'tspan'</a> element. (In the picture above, the
      startpoint-on-the-path is the leftmost dot on the path.)
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the glyph's charwidth (i.e., the amount which
      the current text position advances horizontally when the
      glyph is drawn using horizontal text layout). (In the picture
      above, the charwidth is the distance between the two dots at
      the side of the box.)
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the point on the curve which is charwidth
      distance along the path from the startpoint-on-the-path for
      this glyph, calculated using the user agent's
      <a href="paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance along the
      path</a> algorithm. This point is the
      <dfn id="EndPointOnPath" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">endpoint-on-the-path</dfn> for the
      glyph. (In the picture above, the endpoint-on-the-path for the
      glyph is the rightmost dot on the path.)
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the
      <dfn id="MidPointOnPath" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">midpoint-on-the-path</dfn>, which is
      the point on the path which is "halfway" (user agents can choose
      either a distance calculation or a parametric calculation)
      between the startpoint-on-the-path and the
      endpoint-on-the-path. (In the picture above, the
      midpoint-on-the-path is shown as a white dot.)
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the <dfn id="GlyphMidline" data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">glyph-midline</dfn>, which
      is the vertical line in the glyph's coordinate system that goes
      through the glyph's x-axis midpoint. (In the picture above, the
      glyph-midline is shown as a dashed line.)
    </li>

    <li>
      Position the glyph such that the glyph-midline passes
      through the midpoint-on-the-path and is perpendicular to the
      line through the startpoint-on-the-path and the
      endpoint-on-the-path.
    </li>

    <li>
      Align the glyph vertically relative to the midpoint-on-the-path
      based on property <a>'alignment-baseline'</a> and any specified
      values for attribute <a>'tspan/dy'</a> on a <a>'tspan'</a>
      element. In the example above, the <a>'alignment-baseline'</a>
      property is unspecified, so the initial value
      of <span class="prop-value">alignment-baseline:baseline</span>
      will be used. There are no <a>'tspan'</a> elements; thus, the
      baseline of the glyph is aligned to the
      midpoint-on-the-path.
    </li>

    <li>
      For each subsequent glyph, set a new startpoint-on-the-path as
      the previous endpoint-on-the-path, but with appropriate
      adjustments taking into account horizontal kerning tables in the
      font and current values of various attributes and properties,
      including spacing properties (e.g. <a>'letter-spacing'</a>
      and <a>'word-spacing'</a>) and <a>'tspan'</a> elements with
      values provided
      for attributes <a>'tspan/dx'</a> and <a>'tspan/dy'</a>. All
      adjustments are calculated as distance adjustments along the
      path, calculated using the user
      agent's <a href="paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance along
      the path</a> algorithm.
    </li>

    <li>
      Glyphs whose midpoint-on-the-path are off the path
      are not rendered.
    </li>

    <li>
      Continue rendering glyphs until there are no more glyphs
      (or no more space on path).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Comparable rules are used for top-to-bottom vertical text
    layout along a path (i.e., when the glyph orientation is
    parallel with the <a>inline-base direction</a>,
    the layout rules are as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Determine the startpoint-on-the-path using the same method as
      for horizontal text layout along a path, except that before
      rendering the first glyph, the horizontal component of the
      startpoint-on-the-path is adjusted to take into account various
      vertical alignment text properties and attributes, such as
      a <a>'tspan/dy'</a> attribute value on a <a>'tspan'</a> element.
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the glyph's charheight (i.e., the amount which
      the current text position advances vertically when the glyph
      is drawn using vertical text layout).
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the point on the curve which is charheight
      distance along the path from the startpoint-on-the-path for
      this glyph, calculated using the user agent's
      <a href="paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance along the
      path</a> algorithm. This point is the endpoint-on-the-path for
      the glyph.
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the midpoint-on-the-path, which is the point on the
      path which is "halfway" (user agents can choose either a
      distance calculation or a parametric calculation) between the
      startpoint-on-the-path and the endpoint-on-the-path.
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the glyph-midline, which is the horizontal line in the
      glyph's coordinate system that goes through the glyph's y-axis
      midpoint.
    </li>

    <li>
      Position the glyph such that the glyph-midline passes through
      the midpoint-on-the-path and is perpendicular to the line
      through the startpoint-on-the-path and the endpoint-on-the-path.
    </li>

    <li>
      Align the glyph horizontally (where horizontal is relative to
      the glyph's coordinate system) relative to the
      midpoint-on-the-path based on
      property <a>'alignment-baseline'</a> and any specified values
      for attribute <a>'tspan/dx'</a> on a <a>'tspan'</a> element.
    </li>

    <li>
      For each subsequent glyph, set a new startpoint-on-the-path as
      the previous endpoint-on-the-path, but with appropriate
      adjustments taking into account vertical kerning tables in the
      font and current values of various attributes and properties,
      including spacing
      properties and <a>'tspan'</a> elements with values provided
      for attributes <a>'tspan/dx'</a> and <a>'tspan/dy'</a>. All
      adjustments are calculated as distance adjustments along the
      path, calculated using the user agent's
      <a href="paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance along
      the path</a> algorithm.
    </li>

    <li>
      Glyphs whose midpoint-on-the-path are off either end of
      an <a>open subpath</a> are not rendered.
    </li>

    <li>
      Continue rendering glyphs until there are no more
      glyphs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the calculations above, if either the startpoint-on-the-path or
    the endpoint-on-the-path is off the end of the path, then extend
    the path beyond its end points with a straight line that is
    parallel to the tangent at the path at its end point so that the
    midpoint-on-the-path can still be calculated.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the <a>inline-base direction</a>
    is horizontal, then any <span class="attr-name">'x'</span>
    attributes on <a>'text'</a> or <a>'tspan'</a>
    elements represent new absolute offsets along
    the path, thus providing explicit new values for
    startpoint-on-the-path. Any <span class="attr-name">'y'</span>
    attributes on <a>'text'</a> or <a>'tspan'</a>
    elements are ignored.

    When the <a>inline-base direction</a>
    is vertical, then any <span class="attr-name">'y'</span>
    attributes on <a>'text'</a> or <a>'tspan'</a>
    elements represent new absolute offsets along
    the path, thus providing explicit new values for
    startpoint-on-the-path. Any <span class="attr-name">'x'</span>
    attributes on <a>'text'</a> or <a>'tspan'</a> elements are ignored.
  </p>

  <p>
    After positioning all characters within the <a>'textPath'</a>,
    the <a>current text position</a> is set to the end point of the path,
    after adjusting for the <a>'startOffset'</a> in the case of paths
    that are a single closed loop.
    In other words,
    text that follows a <a>'textPath'</a> element (but is still inside
    a <a>'text'</a> element) that does not have explicit positioning
    information (<a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a> attributes) is
    positioned from the end of the path.

<h2 id="TextRenderingOrder">Text rendering order</h2>

<p>A <a>'text'</a> element is rendered in one or more chunks.
Each chunk (as produced by the <a href="#TextLayoutAlgorithm">text layout algorithm</a>)
is rendered, one after the other, in document order.  Each
rendered chunk, which consists of one or more glyphs,
is filled and stroked as if it were a single path.</p>

<p>
  This means that all glyphs in the chunk should be filled,
  then all glyphs stroked at once,
  or the reverse according to the value of the <a>'paint-order'</a> property.
</p>

<p>For the purposes of painting, a <a>'text'</a> has zero, one, or more
<a>equivalent paths</a>, one for each chunk.  Each equivalent path
consists of one subpath per glyph within that chunk.</p>

<p class="note">Since the <a>'fill-rule'</a> property does not apply
to SVG text elements, the specific order of the subpaths within
the <a>equivalent path</a> does not matter.</p>

<p>The specific position of the start of each subpath, and the direction
that the path progresses around glyph shape, is not defined.
However, user agents should be consistent for a given font and glyph.
</p>

<p class="note">This means that dashed strokes on text may not place
the dash pattern at the same positions across different implementations.</p>


<h2 id="TextProperties">Properties and pseudo-elements</h2>

  <p>
    CSS offers a multitude of properties for styling text. In
    general, only two sets of properties are applicable to SVG: those
    that determine which glyphs are to be rendered
    (<a>'font-family'</a>, <a>'font-style'</a>, etc.) and those that
    apply at the <em>paragraph</em> level (<a>'direction'</a>,
    <a>'writing-mode'</a>, <a>'line-height'</a>, <a>'letter-spacing'</a>,
    etc.).
  </p>

  <p>
    The list of CSS properties that must be supported on SVG text
    elements can be found in the
    <a href="styling.html#RequiredProperties">Styling</a> chapter.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Properties that apply only to pre-formatted text and auto-wrapped
      text where the <a>wrapping area</a> is defined by the
      <a>'inline-size'</a> property:
      <p>
	<a>'text-anchor'</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Properties that apply only to auto-wrapped text except for text
      where the <a>wrapping area</a> is defined by the
      <a>'inline-size'</a> property:
      <p>
	<a>'text-align'</a>,
	<a>'text-align-last'</a>,
	<a>'text-justify'</a>,
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Properties that apply only to auto-wrapped text:
      <p>
	<a>'text-indent'</a>,
	<a>'line-break'</a>,
	<a>'word-break'</a>,
	<a>'hyphens'</a>,
	<a>'word-wrap'</a>,
	<a>'overflow-wrap'</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, the @font-face rule must be supported for
    font selection as well as
    the ::first-line and ::first-letter pseudo-elements must be
    supported on <a>'text'</a> elements.
    In interactive modes, the ::selection pseudo-element must also be supported.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other CSS properties that affect text layout and rendering may
    also be supported by an SVG user agent; their effect should be
    taken into account as part of the CSS text layout step of the
    overall SVG text layout process.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    For example, while SVG 2 does not require support for the
    <a>'text-combine-upright'</a> property, its behavior in an SVG
    context should be obvious.
  </p>

  <p>
    A number of CSS properties must not have any effect on SVG text elements:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Border properties (such as <a>'border-top-style'</a>).  Boxes
      generated by the CSS layout process must not be sized as if they
      had any borders.  The used value for all of
      the <a>'border-style'</a> component longhand properties on SVG
      text elements is <span class='prop-value'>none</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Display property values other than
      <span class='prop-value'>none</span> and
      <span class='prop-value'>inline</span>. Like all other SVG
      elements, any value of <a>'display'</a> on an SVG text element
      other than <span class='prop-value'>none</span> is handled just
      as if it were <span class='prop-value'>inline</span>.  Thus it
      is not possible for a single <a>'text'</a> element to have any
      block children.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <a>'float'</a> property, whose used value on SVG text
      elements is <span class='prop-value'>none</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <a>'position'</a> property, whose used value on SVG text
      elements is <span class='prop-value'>static</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Margin properties (such as <a>'margin-top'</a>), whose used
      values on SVG text elements are
      <span class='prop-value'>0</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <a>'text-align'</a> property when text is pre-formatted,
      whose used value on such SVG text
      elements is <span class='prop-value'>start</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <a>'content'</a> property, whose used value on SVG text
      elements is <span class='prop-value'>none</span>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, the ::before and ::after generated content pseudo-elements
    must not apply to SVG text elements.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    A future specification may introduce support for

<h3 id="TextPropertiesSVG">SVG properties</h3>

  <p>
    This section covers properties that are not covered elsewhere in this
    specification and that are specific to SVG.
  </p>

<h4 id="TextAnchoringProperties">Text alignment, the <span class='property'>'text-anchor'</span> property</h4>

  <p>
    The <a>'text-anchor'</a> property is used to align (start-,
    middle- or end-alignment) a string of <em>pre-formatted</em> text
    or <em>auto-wrapped text</em> where the <a>wrapping area</a>
    is determined from the <a>'inline-size'</a> property
    relative to a given point. It is not applicable to other types of
    <em>auto-wrapped text</em>, see instead <a>'text-align'</a>. For
    multi-line text, the alignment takes place for each line.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a>'text-anchor'</a> property is applied to each individual
    <a>text chunk</a> within a given <a>'text'</a> element. Each text
    chunk has an initial <a>current text position</a>, which
    represents the point in the user coordinate system resulting from
    (depending on context) application of the <a>'text/x'</a>
    and <a>'text/y'</a> attributes on the <a>'text'</a> element,
    any <a>'tspan/x'</a> or <a>'tspan/y'</a> attribute values on
    a <a>'tspan'</a> element assigned explicitly to the first rendered
    character in a text chunk, or determination of the initial current
    text position for a <a>'textPath'</a> element. Each text chunk
    also has a final <a>current text position</a> which is the
    <a>current text position</a> after placing the last glyph
    in the <a>text chunk</a>. The positions are determined before
    applying the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    Values have the following meanings:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class="attr-value">start</span></dt>
    <dd>
      The rendered characters are aligned such that the start of the
      resulting rendered text is at the initial current text position.
      For an element with a <a>'direction'</a> property value
      of <span class="prop-value">"ltr"</span> (typical for most
      European languages), the left side of the text is rendered at
      the initial text position.  For an element with a
      <a>'direction'</a> property value of
      <span class="prop-value">"rtl"</span> (typical for Arabic and
      Hebrew), the right side of the text is rendered at the initial
      text position.  For an element with a vertical primary text
      direction (often typical for Asian text), the top side of the
      text is rendered at the initial text position.
    </dd>

    <dt><span class="attr-value">middle</span></dt>
    <dd>
      The rendered characters are shifted such that the geometric
      middle of the resulting rendered text (determined from the
      initial and final <a>current text position</a> before applying
      the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property) is at the initial current
      text position.
    </dd>

    <dt><span class="attr-value">end</span></dt>
    <dd>
      The rendered characters are shifted such that the end of the
      resulting rendered text (final <a>current text position</a>
      before applying the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property)
      is at the initial current text position.
      For an element with a <a>'direction'</a> property value
      of <span class="prop-value">"ltr"</span> (typical for most
      European languages), the right side of the text is rendered at
      the initial text position.  For an element with
      a <a>'direction'</a> property value
      of <span class="prop-value">"rtl"</span> (typical for Arabic and
      Hebrew), the left side of the text is rendered at the initial
      text position.  For an element with a vertical primary text
      direction (often typical for Asian text), the bottom of the text
      is rendered at the initial text position.

  <h4 id='GlyphOrientationHorizontalProperty'>The <span class="property">'glyph-orientation-horizontal'</span> property</h4>

  <p class="note">
    This property has been removed in SVG 2.
  </p>

  <h4 id='GlyphOrientationVerticalProperty'>The <span class="property">'glyph-orientation-vertical'</span> property</h4>

  <p>
    This property applies only to vertical text. It has been obsoleted
    in SVG 2 and partially replaced by the <a>'text-orientation'</a>
    property of CSS Writing Modes Level 3. The following SVG 1.1
    values must still be supported by aliasing the property
    as a shorthand to <a>'text-orientation'</a> as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="prop-value">'auto'</span> to
      <span class="prop-value">'mixed'</span>;
    </li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    Any other values must be treated as invalid.
  </p>


<h4 id='KerningProperty'>The <span class="property">'kerning'</span> property</h4>

  <p class="note">
    The <span class="property">'kerning'</span> property has been
    removed in SVG 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    SVG 1.1 uses the 'kerning' property to determine if the font
    kerning tables should be used to adjust inter-glyph
    spacing. It also allows a
    <span class="prop-value">&lt;length&gt;</span> value which
    if given is added to the spacing between glyphs (supplemental
    to any from the <a>'letter-spacing'</a> property). This
    property is replaced in SVG 2 by the
    CSS <a>'font-kerning'</a> property which solely controls
    turning on/off the use of the font kerning tables.

<h4 id='FontVariantProperty'>The <span class="property">'font-variant'</span> property</h4>

  <em>This section is not normative</em>

  <p>The <a>'font-variant'</a> property gets defined by the CSS Font Module
    ([<a href="refs.html#ref-css-fonts-3">css-font-3</a>]).
</p>

  <p>
    CSS Font Module changes the meaning of the
    <a>'font-variant'</a>
    property from that defined by CSS 2.1. It has been repurposed (and
    its functionality greatly expanded) as a shorthand for selecting font
    variants from within a single font.
  </p>

  <p>
    SVG 2 supports all <a>'font-variant'</a> longhand properties (e.g. <a>'font-variant-ligatures'</a>).
  </p>

  <h4 id='LineHeightProperty'>The <span class="property">'line-height'</span> property</h4>

  <p>
    SVG uses the <a>'line-height'</a> property to determine the amount
    of leading space which is added between lines in multi-line text
    (both for horizontal and vertical text). It is not applicable to
    text on a path.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Except for the additional information provided here, the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#line-height">normative
      definition</a> of the <a>'line-height'</a> property is in the CSS 2.1
      specification

  </p>

  <p class="annotation">
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/">CSS Inline Module

  </p>

  <h4 id='WritingModeProperty'>The <span class="property">'writing-mode'</span> property</h4>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p>The <a>'writing-mode'</a> property gets defined by the CSS Writing Modes Module
        ([<a href="refs.html#ref-css-writing-modes-3">css-writing-modes-3</a>]).
    </p>

  <p>
    This property sets the <a>block-flow direction</a>; or in-other-words,
    the direction in which lines of text are stacked. As a consequence it
    also determines if the text has a horizontal or vertical orientation.
  </p>
  <p class="annotation">
    SVG 2 references
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3">CSS Writing
      Modes Level 3</a> for the definition of the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#block-flow">'writing-mode'</a>
    property. That specification introduces new values for the property.
    The SVG 1.1 values are obsolete but must still be supported by
    converting the specified values to computed values as follows:
  </p>

  <p class="annotation"><!-- This could be an annotation. -->
    In SVG 1.0, this property could be interpreted as to also setting the
    <a>inline-base direction</a> leading to confusion about its role
    relative to the <a>'direction'</a> property. SVG 1.1 was a bit
    more specific about the role of <a>'direction'</a>
    (e.g. that <a>'direction'</a> set the reference point for
    the <a>'text-anchor'</a> property) but still was open to
    interpretation. The fact that neither SVG 1.0 nor SVG 1.1 allowed
    multi-line text added to the confusion.
  </p>

  <h4 id='DirectionProperty'>The <span class="property">'direction'</span> property</h4>

  <p>
    The property specifies the <a>inline-base direction</a> of a
    <a>'text'</a> or <a>'tspan'</a> element. It defines the
    <q>start</q> and <q>end</q> points of a line of text as used by
    the <a>'text-anchor'</a> and <a>'inline-size'</a> properties. It
    also may affect the direction in which characters are positioned
    if the <a>'unicode-bidi'</a> property's value is either
    <span class='prop-value'>embed</span> or
    <span class='prop-value'>bidi-override</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a>'direction'</a> property applies only to glyphs oriented
    perpendicular to the <a>inline-base direction</a>,
    which includes the usual case of horizontally-oriented Latin or
    Arabic text and the case of narrow-cell Latin or Arabic characters
    rotated 90 degrees clockwise relative to a top-to-bottom
    <a>inline-base direction</a>.

    In many cases, the bidirectional algorithm from Unicode
    [<a href="refs.html#ref-unicode">UNICODE</a>] produces the desired
    result automatically, and in such cases the author does not need
    to use these properties. For other cases, such as when using
    right-to-left languages, it may be sufficient to add the
    <a>'direction'</a> property to the <a>outermost svg element</a>,
    and allow that direction to inherit to all text elements, as in the
    following example (which may be used as a template):

<h4 id='DominantBaselineProperty'>The <span class="property">'dominant-baseline'</span> property</h4>

  <p class="note">
    This property is defined in the CSS Line Layout Module 3 specification. See
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-dominant-baseline">'dominant-baseline'</a>.
    [<a href="refs.html#ref-css-inline-3">css-inline-3</a>]
  </p>

  <p>
    SVG 2 introduces some changes to the definition of this property.
    In particular:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The 'reset-size' value is no longer supported.  Any change
      in <a>'font-size'</a> resets the dominant baseline table.
    </li>
    <li>
      The 'use-script' and 'no-change' values are no longer supported.
    </li>
    <li>
      The property is now inherited. (Behavior is effectively unchanged.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    SVG uses the value of the <a>'dominant-baseline'</a> property to
    align glyphs relative to the <a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a>
    attributes. For the <a>'text-orientation'</a> value
    <span class="prop-value">sideways</span>, the
    <span class="prop-value">auto</span> value for
    <a>'dominant-baseline'</a> is
    <span class="prop-value">alphabetic</span>; however, for backwards
    compatibility, the glyphs should be aligned to the
    <a>'tspan/x'</a> and <a>'tspan/y'</a> attributes using the
    value <span class="prop-value">central</span>.

    have been removed. For backwards compatibility, 'text-before-edge'
    should be mapped to 'text-top' and 'text-after-edge' should be
    mapped to 'text-bottom'. Neither 'text-before-edge' nor

    <a>'white-space'</a> property has the value
    <span class="prop-value">nowrap</span>. The property does not
    apply to pre-formatted text or text-on-a-path.
  </p>

  <p>
    In SVG <a>'text-overflow'</a> has an effect if there is a validly
    specified <a>wrapping area</a>, regardless of the computed value
    of the <a>'overflow'</a> property on the <a>text content block
    element</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the <a>'text-overflow'</a> property has the value
    <span class="prop-value">ellipsis</span> then if the text that is
    to be rendered overflows the <a>wrapping area</a> an ellipsis is
    rendered such that it fits within the given area. For the
    purposes of rendering, the ellipsis is treated as if it replaced
    the characters at the point where it is inserted.
  </p>
    <!--The text positioning attributes
    (<a>'text/x'</a>, <a>'text/y'</a>, <a>'text/dx'</a>, <a>'text/dy'</a>, <a>'text/rotate'</a>)
    apply to the ellipsis as if it was one character in the logical
    document order mapping to one glyph.-->

  <p>
    If the <a>'text-overflow'</a> property has the value
    <span class="prop-value">clip</span> then any text
    that overflows the <a>wrapping area</a> is clipped.
    Characters may be partially rendered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any other value for <a>'text-overflow'</a> is treated as if it
    wasn't specified.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the effect of <a>'text-overflow'</a> is purely visual,
    the ellipsis itself does not become part of the DOM. For all the
    DOM methods it is as if <a>'text-overflow'</a> was not applied, and
    as if the <a>wrapping area</a> did not constrain the text.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    <p>
      The following example shows the use of <a>'text-overflow'</a>.
      The top line shows text as it would normally be rendered (text
      overflows due to <a>'white-space'</a> value
      <span class="prop-value">pre</span> and is displayed due to
      <a>'overflow'</a> value <span class="prop-value">visible</span>).

      The middle line shows text with <a>'text-overflow'</a> value
      <span class="prop-value">clip</span>, and

      the bottom line shows text with <a>'text-overflow'</a> value
      <span class="prop-value">ellipsis</span>.

<h4 id="LegacyXMLSpace">Legacy white-space handling, the <span class='property'>'xml:space'</span> property</h4>

  <p id="XMLSpaceAttribute">
    For compatibility, SVG 2 also supports the  XML attribute
    <a>'xml:space'</a> to specify the handling of white space
    characters within a given <a>'text'</a> element's character
    data. New content should not use <a>'xml:space'</a> but
    instead, use the <a>'white-space'</a> property.
  </p>

  <p class="annotation">
    This section should be simplified to limit the discussion of
    xml:space and instead define it in the user agent style sheet using the
    <a>'white-space'</a> property. The
    <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-4/">CSS Text 4</a>
    specification's
    <span class="prop-value">preserve-spaces</span> value for the
    <a class="property"
      href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-4/#white-space-collapsing">'white-space-collapse'</a>
    property is intended to match
    <span class="prop-value">xml:space=preserve</span>.
    (<a href="https://log.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/2015-02-08/#e519951">fantasai
    agreed</a> to add an appropriate value for <a>'white-space'</a> to
    match SVG 1.1's odd xml:space="preserve" behavior.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that any child element of a <a>'text'</a> element may also
    have an <a>'xml:space'</a> attribute which will apply to that
    child element's text content.  The SVG user agent has special
    processing rules associated with this attribute as described
    below. These are behaviors that occur subsequent to XML parsing
    [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML</a>]
    and any construction of a DOM.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a>'xml:space'</a> is an inheritable attribute which can have one of
    two values:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class='attr-value'>'default'</span></dt>
    <dd>
      (The initial/default value for <a>'xml:space'</a>.) When
      <span class='attr-value'>xml:space="default"</span>, the SVG
      user agent will do the following using a copy of the original
      character data content. First, it will remove all newline
      characters. Then it will convert all tab characters into space
      characters. Then, it will strip off all leading and trailing
      space characters. Then, all contiguous space characters will be
      consolidated.
    </dd>

    <dt><span class='attr-value'>'preserve'</span></dt>
    <dd>
      When <span class='attr-value'>xml:space="preserve"</span>, the
      SVG user agent will do the following using a copy of the
      original character data content. It will convert all newline and
      tab characters into space characters. Then, it will draw all
      space characters, including leading, trailing and multiple
      contiguous space characters. Thus, when drawn with
      <span class='attr-value'>xml:space="preserve"</span>, the string
      <code>"a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b"</code> (three spaces between "a"
      and "b") will produce a larger separation between "a" and "b"
      than <code>"a&nbsp;b"</code> (one space between "a" and "b").
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    The following example illustrates that line indentation can be
    important when using
    <span class='attr-value'>xml:space="default"</span>.  The fragment
    below show two pairs of similar <a>'text'</a> elements, with
    both <a>'text'</a> elements using
    <span class="attr-value">xml:space="default"</span>. For
    these examples, there is no extra white space at the end of any of
    the lines (i.e., the line break occurs immediately after the last
    visible character).
  </p>

  <pre>
[01]  &lt;text xml:space='default'&gt;
[02]    WS example
[03]    indented lines
[04]  &lt;/text&gt;
[05]  &lt;text xml:space='preserve'&gt;WS example indented lines&lt;/text&gt;
[06]
[07]  &lt;text xml:space='default'&gt;
[08]WS example
[09]non-indented lines
[10]  &lt;/text&gt;
[11]  &lt;text xml:space='preserve'&gt;WS examplenon-indented lines&lt;/text&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    The first pair of <a>'text'</a> elements above show the
    effect of indented character data. The attribute
    <span class="attr-value">xml:space="default"</span> in the first
    <a>'text'</a> element instructs the user agent to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>convert all tabs (if any) to space characters,</li>
    <li>strip out all line breaks (i.e., strip out the line
    breaks at the end of lines [01], [02] and [03]),</li>
    <li>strip out all leading space characters (i.e., strip out
    space characters before "WS example" on line [02]),</li>
    <li>strip out all trailing space characters (i.e., strip out
    space characters before "&lt;/text&gt;" on line [04]),</li>
    <li>consolidate all intermediate space characters (i.e., the
    space characters before "indented lines" on line [03]) into a
    single space character.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The second pair of <a>'text'</a> elements above show the
    effect of non-indented character data. The attribute
    <span class="attr-value">xml:space="default"</span> in the third
    <a>'text'</a> element instructs the user agent to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>convert all tabs (if any) to space characters,</li>
    <li>strip out all line breaks (i.e., strip out the line
    breaks at the end of lines [07], [08] and [09]),</li>
    <li>strip out all leading space characters (there are no
    leading space characters in this example),</li>
    <li>strip out all trailing space characters (i.e., strip out
    space characters before "&lt;/text&gt;" on line [10]),</li>
    <li>consolidate all intermediate space characters into a
    single space character (in this example, there are no
    intermediate space characters).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that XML parsers are required to convert the standard
    representations for a newline indicator (e.g., the literal
    two-character sequence "U+000D U+000A", CARRIAGE-RETURN LINE-FEED
    or the stand-alone literals U+000D or U+000A) into the single
    character U+000A before passing character data to the
    application. Thus, each newline in SVG will be represented by the
    single character U+000A, no matter what representation for
    newlines might have been used in the original resource. (See
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-line-ends">XML
    end-of-line handling</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Any features in the SVG language or the SVG DOM that are based
    on character position number, such as the <a>'tspan/x'</a>,
    <a>'tspan/y'</a>, <a>'tspan/dx'</a>, <a>'tspan/dy'</a> and
    <a>'tspan/rotate'</a> attributes on the <a>'text'</a> and <a>'tspan'</a>
    elements, are based on
    character position after applying the white space handling rules
    described here.  In particular,
    if <span class='attr-value'>xml:space="default"</span>, it is
    often the case that white space characters are removed as part of
    processing. Character position numbers index into the text string
    after the white space characters have been removed per the rules
    in this section.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that a glyph corresponding to a white-space character should
    only be displayed as a visible but blank space, even if the glyph
    itself happens to be non-blank.
    See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/unsup_char.html">display
    of unsupported characters</a>
    [<a href="refs.html#ref-unicode">UNICODE</a>].
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a>'xml:space'</a> attribute is:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="anim-target"><a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/#Animatable">Animatable</a>:
    no.</span>
  </p>

<h4 id="DuplicateWhiteSpace">Duplicate white-space directives</h4>

  <p>
    Older, SVG 1.1 content will use <a>'xml:space'</a>. New content,
    and older content that is being reworked, will use
    <a>'white-space'</a> and remove any existing
    <a>'xml:space'</a>. However, user agents may come across content
    which uses both methods on the same element. If
    the <a>'white-space'</a> property is set on any element, then the
    value of <a>'xml:space'</a> is ignored.
  </p>



<h2 id="TextDecorationProperties">Text decoration</h2>

  <p>
    Text in SVG can be <em>decorated</em> with an underline, overline,
    and/or strike-through. The position and style of the decoration is
    determined respectively by the <a>'text-decoration-line'</a> and
    <a>'text-decoration-style'</a> properties, or by
    the <a>'text-decoration'</a> shorthand property as defined in the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/#line-decoration">Line
      Decoration</a> section of the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/">CSS Text
    Decoration Module Level 3</a>
    [(<a href="refs.html#ref-css-text-decor-3">css-text-decor-3</a>)]
    specification.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fill and stroke of the text decoration are
    given by the fill and stroke of the text at the point
    where the text decoration is declared (see example below).
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The <a>'text-decoration-line'</a> and
    <a>'text-decoration-style'</a> properties are new in SVG 2. The
    SVG 1.1/CSS 2.1 <a>'text-decoration'</a> property is transformed
    in a backwards compatible way to a short hand for these
    properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    The order in which the text and decorations are drawn is defined
    by the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/#painting-order">Painting
      Order of Text Decorations</a> section of
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/">CSS Text
    Decoration Module Level 3</a>. The paint order of the text
    decoration itself (fill/stroke) is determined by the value of the
    <a>'paint-order'</a> property at the point where the text
    decoration is declared.
  </p>

  <p id="ExampleTextDecoration01">
    <span class="example-ref">Example textdecoration01</span> provides
    examples for <a>'text-decoration'</a>. The first line of text has
    no value for <a>'text-decoration'</a>, so the initial value
    of <span class="prop-value">text-decoration:none</span> is
    used. The second line shows
    <span class="prop-value">text-decoration:line-through</span>. The
    third line shows
    <span class="prop-value">text-decoration:underline</span>. The
    fourth line illustrates the rule whereby decorations are rendered
    using the same fill and stroke properties as are present on the
    element for which the <a>'text-decoration'</a> is specified. Since
    <a>'text-decoration'</a> is specified on the <a>'text'</a>
    element, all text within the <a>'text'</a> element has its
    underline rendered with the same fill and stroke properties as
    exist on the <a>'text'</a> element (i.e., blue fill, red stroke),
    even though the various words have different fill and stroke
    property values. However, the word "different" explicitly
    specifies a value for <a>'text-decoration'</a>; thus, its
    underline is rendered using the fill and stroke properties as
    the <a>'tspan'</a> element that surrounds the word "different"
    (i.e., yellow fill, darkgreen stroke):

<h2 id="TextSelection">Text selection and clipboard operations</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="conform.html#ConformingSVGViewers">Conforming SVG
    viewers</a> on systems which have the capacity for text selection (e.g.,
    systems which are equipped with a pointer device such as a mouse) and
    which have system clipboards for copy/paste operations are required to
    support:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>user selection of text strings in SVG content</li>
    <li>the ability to copy selected text strings to the system clipboard</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A text selection operation starts when all of the following occur:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      the user positions the pointing device over a glyph that has
      been rendered as part of a <a>'text'</a> element, initiates a
      <em>select</em> operation (e.g., pressing the standard system
      mouse button for select operations) and then moves the pointing
      device while continuing the <em>select</em> operation (e.g.,
      continuing to press the standard system mouse button for select
      operations)
    </li>

    <li>
      no other visible graphics element has been painted above the glyph
      at the point at which the pointing device was clicked
    </li>

    <li>
      no <a href="linking.html#Links">links</a> or
      <a href="interact.html">events</a> have been
      assigned to the <a>'text'</a>, <a>'tspan'</a> or
      <a>'textPath'</a> element(s) (or their ancestors) associated
      with the given glyph.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As the text selection operation proceeds (e.g., the user continues
    to press the given mouse button), all associated events with other
    graphics elements are ignored (i.e., the text selection operation
    is modal) and the SVG user agent shall dynamically indicate which
    characters are selected by applying styles for the <code>::selection</code> pseudo-class.
    As the
    pointer is moved during the text selection process, the end glyph
    for the text selection operation is the glyph within the
    same <a>'text'</a> element whose glyph cell is closest to the
    pointer. All characters within the <a>'text'</a> element whose
    position within the <a>'text'</a> element is between the start of
    selection and end of selection shall be highlighted, regardless of
    position on the canvas and regardless of any graphics elements
    that might be above the end of selection point.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once the text selection operation ends (e.g., the user releases
    the given mouse button), the selected text will stay highlighted
    until an event occurs which cancels text selection, such as a
    pointer device activation event (e.g., pressing a mouse button).
  </p>

  <p>
    Detailed rules for determining which characters to highlight
    during a text selection operation are provided in
    <a href="#TextSelectionImplementationNotes">Text
      selection implementation notes</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For systems which have system clipboards, the SVG user agent is
    required to provide a user interface for initiating a copy of the
    currently selected text to the system clipboard. It is sufficient
    for the SVG user agent to post the selected text string in the
    system's appropriate clipboard format for plain text, but it is
    preferable if the SVG user agent also posts a rich text
    alternative which captures the various font properties associated
    with the given text string.
  </p>

  <p>
    For bidirectional text, the user agent must support text selection
    in logical order, which will result in discontinuous highlighting
    of glyphs due to the bidirectional reordering of characters. User
    agents can provide an alternative ability to select bidirectional
    text in visual rendering order (i.e., after bidirectional
    text layout algorithms have been applied), with the result that
    selected character data might be discontinuous logically. In this
    case, if the user requests that bidirectional text be copied to
    the clipboard, then the user agent is required to make appropriate
    adjustments to copy only the visually selected characters to the
    clipboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    SVG authors and <a>SVG generators</a> should
    order their text strings to facilitate properly ordered text
    selection within SVG viewing applications such as Web browsers;
    in other words, the DOM order of the text should match
    the natural reading order of the text.
  </p>

<h3 id="TextSelectionImplementationNotes">Text selection implementation notes</h3>

<p>The following implementation notes describe the algorithm
for deciding which characters are selected during a <a
href="#TextSelection">text selection</a>
operation.</p>

<p>As the text selection operation occurs (e.g., while the user
clicks and drags the mouse to identify the selection), the user
agent determines a <em>start selection position</em> and an
<em>end selection position</em>, each of which represents a
position in the text string between two characters. After
determining start selection position and end selection
position, the user agent selects the appropriate characters,
where the resulting text selection consists of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no selection or</li>

  <li>a <em>start character</em>, an <em>end character</em>
  (possibly the same character), and all of the characters
  within the same <a>'text'</a> element whose position
  in the DOM is logically between the start character and end
  character.</li>
</ul>

<p>On systems with pointer devices, to determine the <em>start
selection position</em>, the SVG user agent determines which
boundary between characters corresponding to rendered glyphs is
the best target (e.g., closest) based on the current pointer
location at the time of the event that initiates the selection
operation (e.g., the mouse down event). The user agent then
tracks the completion of the selection operation (e.g., the
mouse drag, followed ultimately by the mouse up). At the end of
the selection operation, the user agent determines which
boundary between characters is the best target (e.g., closest)
for the <em>end selection position</em>.</p>

<p>If no character reordering has occurred due to bidirectionality,
then the selection consists of all characters between the
<em>start selection position</em> and <em>end selection
position</em>. For example, if a <a>'text'</a> element contains the
string "abcdef" and the start selection position and end
selection positions are 0 and 3 respectively (assuming the left
side of the "a" is position zero), then the selection will
consist of "abc".</p>

<p>When the user agent is implementing selection of
bidirectional text, and when the selection starts (or ends)
between characters which are not contiguous in logical order,
then there might be multiple potential combinations of
characters that can be considered part of the selection. The
algorithms to choose among the combinations of potential
selection options shall choose the selection option which most
closely matches the text string's visual rendering order.</p>
<p>When multiple characters map inseparably to a given set of
one or more glyphs, the user agent can either disallow the
selection to start in the middle of the glyph set or can
attempt to allocate portions of the area taken up by the glyph
set to the characters that correspond to the glyph.</p>

<p>For systems which support pointer devices such as a mouse,
the user agent is required to provide a mechanism for selecting
text even when the given text has associated event handlers or
links, which might block text selection due to event processing
precedence rules (see <a href="interact.html#PointerEvents">Pointer events</a>).
One implementation option: For platforms which support a pointer
device such as a mouse, the user agent may provide for a small
additional region around character cells which initiates text
selection operations but does not initiate event handlers or
links.</p>

<h3 id="InterfaceSVGTextContentElement">Interface SVGTextContentElement</h3>

<p>The <a>SVGTextContentElement</a> interface is implemented by elements
that support rendering child text content.</p>

<p>For the methods on this interface that refer to an index to a
character or a number of characters, these references are to be
interpreted as an index to a UTF-16 code unit or a number of
UTF-16 code units, respectively.  This is for consistency with DOM
Level 2 Core, where methods on the <a>CharacterData</a> interface
use UTF-16 code units as indexes and counts within the character
data. Thus for example, if the text content of a <a>'text'</a>
element is a single non-BMP character, such as U+10000, then
invoking <a>SVGTextContentElement::getNumberOfChars</a> on that
element will return 2 since there are two UTF-16 code units (the
surrogate pair) used to represent that one character.</p>

<p class="note">
The initial value of the <a>'textLength'</a> content attribute

</div>

<p>The <b id="__svg__SVGTextContentElement__getComputedTextLength">getComputedTextLength</b>
method is used to compute a "length" for the text within the element.
When getComputedTextLength() is called, the following steps are run:</p>

<ol class='algorithm'>
  <li>Let <var>count</var> be the value that would be returned if
  the <a href="#__svg__SVGTextContentElement__getNumberOfChars">getNumberOfChars</a>

  <li>Return <var>length</var>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <b id="__svg__SVGTextContentElement__getSubStringLength">getSubStringLength</b>
method is used to compute the formatted text advance distance for a substring of text within the
element.  When getSubStringLength(<var>charnum</var>, <var>nchars</var>)
is called, the following steps are run:</p>

<ol class='algorithm'>
  <li>Assign an index to each <a>addressable character</a> in the DOM within this element,

  <li>If <var>charnum</var> is greater than the highest index assigned

<p class="note">
  Previous versions of SVG required that this method
  and <a>getComputedTextLength</a>
  also include
  positioning adjustments in the inline direction due to
  <a>'tspan/dx'</a> or <a>'tspan/dy'</a> on child elements,
  so that the returned value would be equivalent to

  However, it was poorly specified,
  poorly implemented,
  and of dubious benefit,
  so has been simplified to match implementations.
