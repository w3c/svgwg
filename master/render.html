<h1>Rendering Model</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Implementations of SVG are expected to behave as though they
implement a rendering (or imaging) model corresponding to the
one described in this chapter. A real implementation is not
required to implement the model in this way, but the result on
any device supported by the implementation shall match that
described by this model.</p>

<p>The appendix on <a href="conform.html">conformance
requirements</a> describes the extent to which an actual
implementation may deviate from this description. In practice
an actual implementation will deviate slightly because of
limitations of the output device (e.g. only a limited range of
colors might be supported) and because of practical limitations
in implementing a precise mathematical model (e.g. for
realistic performance curves are approximated by straight
lines, the approximation need only be sufficiently precise to
match the conformance requirements).</p>

<h2 id="PaintersModel">The painters model</h2>

<div class="ready-for-wg-review">

<p>SVG uses a "painters model" of rendering. <a>Paint</a>
is applied in successive operations to the output device such
that each operation paints onto some area of the output device,
possibly obscuring paint that has previously been layed down.

After each object or group is painted, it becomes part of the background
for the next painting operation.

SVG 2 supports advanced blending modes and compositing operations that
control how each painting operation interacts with the background.
The rules governing these painting operations are outlined in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/compositing/">Compositing and Blending Specification</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="RenderingOrder">Rendering order</h2>

<p>Elements in an SVG document fragment have an implicit
drawing order, with the first elements in the SVG document
fragment getting "painted" first. Subsequent elements are
painted on top of previously painted elements.</p>

<h2 id="Grouping">How groups are rendered</h2>
<div class="ready-for-wg-review">
<p>
Grouping elements, such as the <a>'g'</a> element (see <a>container elements</a>) create a <a>compositing group</a>.
The compositing group will composite and blend with the <a>group backdrop</a> with behaviour depending on the values
of the compositing and blending properties, such as <a>knock-out</a>, and <a>isolation</a>. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/compositing/">Compositing and Blending Specification</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Elements">How elements are rendered</h2>
<div class="ready-for-wg-review">
<p>
Individual <a>graphics elements</a> are rendered as if each graphics element
represented its own <a>compositing group</a>; thus, the effect is as if
a temporary separate canvas is created for each graphics element.
The element is first painted onto the temporary canvas (see
<a href="render.html#PaintingShapesAndText">Painting shapes and text</a> and
<a href="render.html#PaintingRasterImages">Painting raster images</a> below).
Then any <a href="render.html#FilteringPaintRegions">filter effects</a>
specified for the graphics element are applied to create a
modified temporary canvas. The modified temporary canvas is
then composited into the background, taking into account any
<a href="render.html#ClippingMaskingObjectOpacity">clipping,
masking and object opacity</a> settings on the graphics
element.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="TypesOfGraphicsElements">Types of graphics elements</h2>

<p>SVG supports three fundamental types of <a>graphics elements</a>
that can be rendered onto the canvas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a>Shapes</a>, which represent some combination of straight line
  and curves</li>
  <li>Text, which represents some combination of character glyphs</li>
  <li>Raster images, which represent an array of values that
  specify the paint color and opacity (often termed alpha) at a
  series of points on a rectangular grid. (SVG requires support
  for specified raster image formats under
  <a href="conform.html">conformance requirements</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="PaintingShapesAndText">Painting shapes and text</h3>

<p>Shapes and text can be <a>filled</a> (i.e., apply paint to the
interior of the shape) and <a>stroked</a> (i.e., apply paint
along the outline of the shape). A stroke operation is centered
on the outline of the object; thus, in effect, half of the
paint falls on the interior of the shape and half of the paint
falls outside of the shape.</p>

<p>For certain types of shapes, <a href="painting.html#Markers">marker
symbols</a> (which themselves can consist of any combination of shapes,
text and images) can be drawn at selected vertices. Each marker symbol
is painted as if its graphical content were expanded into the
SVG document tree just after the shape object which is using
the given marker symbol. The graphical contents of a marker
symbol are rendered using the same methods as graphics
elements. Marker symbols are not applicable to text.</p>

<p>The fill is painted first, then the stroke, and then the
marker symbols. The marker symbols are rendered in order along
the outline of the shape, from the start of the shape to the
end of the shape.</p>

<p>Each fill and stroke operation has its own opacity settings;
thus, you can fill and/or stroke a shape with a
semi-transparently drawn solid color, with different opacity
values for the fill and stroke operations.</p>

<p>The fill and stroke operations are entirely independent
painting operations; thus, if you both fill and stroke a shape,
half of the stroke will be painted on top of part of the
fill.</p>

<p>SVG supports the following built-in types of paint which can
be used in fill and stroke operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="color.html#ColorIntroduction">solid color</a></li>
  <li><a href="pservers.html#Gradients">gradients</a> (linear and radial)</li>
  <li><a href="pservers.html#Patterns">patterns</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="PaintingRasterImages">Painting raster images</h3>

<p>When a raster image is rendered, the original samples are
"resampled" using standard algorithms to produce samples at the
positions required on the output device. Resampling
requirements are discussed under
<a href="conform.html">conformance requirements</a>.</p>

<h2 id="FilteringPaintRegions">Filtering painted regions</h2>

<div class="issue">
    This section needs more detail on the interaction between compositing and blending and filter effects.
    Waiting on the Compositing and Blending spec to define the accumulated background removal process.
    Filtering will need to fit into that process as the final step before the group buffer is composited with the page.
</div>

<p>SVG allows any painting operation to be filtered. (See
<a href="filters.html">Filter Effects</a>.)</p>

<p>In this case the result must be as though the paint
operations had been applied to an intermediate canvas
initialized to transparent black, of a size determined by the
rules given in <a href="filters.html">Filter Effects</a> then
filtered by the processes defined in
<a href="filters.html">Filter Effects</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ClippingMaskingObjectOpacity">Clipping, masking and object opacity</h2>

<p>SVG allows any painting operation to be limited to a
subregion of the output device by clipping and masking. This is
described in <a href="masking.html">Clipping, Masking and
Compositing</a>.</p>
<div class="issue">Need to remove reference to compositing in the Clipping, Masking and Compositing chapter.</div>

<p>Clipping uses a path to define a region of the output device
to which paint can be applied. Any painting operation executed
within the scope of the clipping must be rendered such that
only those parts of the device that fall within the clipping
region are affected by the painting operation. A <a>clipping path</a>
can be thought of as a mask wherein those pixels outside the
clipping path are black with an alpha value of zero and those
pixels inside the clipping path are white with an alpha value
of one. "Within" is defined by the same rules used to determine
the interior of a path for painting. The clipping path is
typically anti-aliased on low-resolution devices (see
<a>'shape-rendering'</a>. Clipping is
described in
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/default/masking/index.html#clipping-paths">Clipping paths</a>
from <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/default/masking/index.html#clipping-paths"><cite>CSS Masking</cite></a>
([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS-MASKING">CSS-MASKING</a>], section 8).</p>

<div class="ready-for-wg-review">
<p>Masking uses the luminance of the color channels and alpha
channel in a referenced SVG element to define a supplemental
set of alpha values which are multiplied to the alpha values
already present in the graphics to which the mask is applied.
The resulting alpha value is used as input to the Compositing
and Blending operations described in the Compositing and Blending Specification [<a href="refs.html#ref-COMPOSITINGBLENDING">COMPOSITING-BLENDING</a>].
Masking is described in detail in
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/default/masking/index.html"><cite>CSS Masking</cite></a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS-MASKING">CSS-MASKING</a>].</dd>

<p>A supplemental masking operation may also be specified by
applying a "global" opacity to a set of rendering operations.
In this case the mask is infinite, with a color of white and an
alpha channel of the given opacity value. (See the <a>'opacity'</a>
property.)</p>
</div>

<h2 id="ParentCompositing">Parent Compositing</h2>

<p>SVG document fragments can be semi-opaque. In many
environments (e.g., Web browsers), the SVG document fragment
has a final compositing step where the document as a whole is
blended translucently into the background canvas.</p>
